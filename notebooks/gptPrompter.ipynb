      "the Chinese government could order TikTok to control what videos Americans could watch. - [Narrator] TikTok says\n",
      "it has already started to address some of those concerns. The company recently said that all US user traffic is now being routed through cloud servers operated by the US based company Oracle. And TikTok says that only members of its US data security team\n",
      "have access to that data. But backups are still being saved to other non-Oracle servers in the US and Singapore, the company says, but it's phasing those out. As for TikTok's recommendation algorithm, that was created by its Chinese\n",

      "hobble Chinese companies has become a go-to tool\n",
      "for the US government.\" But some US lawmakers still want TikTok to have more separation from China. One option is a divestiture\n",

      "Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, opens a case with\n",
      "the involved companies. This is the panel that's\n",
      "been talking to TikTok. It's made up of representatives of nine US departments and agencies, led by the Treasury, and reviews foreign transactions to see if they might be a national security risk. After CFIUS reviews a company or merger, it can make recommendations\n",
      "to mitigate those risks, which can include asking foreign investors or owners to sell their\n",
      "stake in the company. In extreme cases, it can\n",
      "also escalate the case to the president, who\n",
      "can order a forced sale. That owner then has to\n",
      "find a suitable buyer, usually one within the US. Then the buyer and seller\n",
      "might have to go back to CFIUS in order to\n",
      "get the sale approved. Grindr took just over a year\n",
      "after the order was made to find a buyer and get approval. The president never issued an order. But TikTok is a much bigger name and forcing a sale could\n",
      "be more complicated. - There's been nothing of\n",
      "this scale, this popularity. Usually, you know, CFIUS deals with a lot smaller cases here. So this is like the case of the century for CFIUS\n",
      "lawyers in Washington in DC. - [Narrator] A treasury official said that CFIUS does not publicly comment on transactions that it may\n",
      "or may not be reviewing. Officials are worried about a number of challenges\n",
      "facing a forced sale. One is that the Trump\n",
      "administration already tried it. - They have till September\n",
      "15th to make a deal. After that, we closed\n",
      "it up in this country. - [Narrator] In 2020, that administration issued an order that would've\n",
      "effectively banned TikTok, unless it sold itself to a US buyer. But TikTok pushed back and took the order to a federal appeals court, arguing that the deal denied\n",
      "the company due process. It was still tied up in legal issues by the time Joe Biden got into office, and the order was shelved as his administration conducted\n",
      "its own security review. But his administration\n",
      "could face similar pushback from TikTok if it tries to force a sale, and doing so could risk\n",
      "diluting CFIUS' authority. - Their power is based on having these vague broad powers, and if they go to court,\n",
      "even if they win in court, a court might put parameters on that power, might define that power, 'cause the more vague your power is, the more powerful it is. - [Narrator] Even without legal hurdles, a sale would also need cooperation from the Chinese government, which has the power to restrict the exports of technology, such as TikTok's video\n",

      "in a majority of states. And in December, the federal government\n",

      "from operating in the US? Especially when it has more than 100 million American users. - [Narrator] While TikTok\n",
