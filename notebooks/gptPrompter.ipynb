      "lose money over time.. And this is obviously not good.. Even if you put your money\n",
      "in a savings account,. like these days,. a savings account will\n",
      "give you like 0.2% interest. which means your money\n",
      "goes up by 0.2% every year.. But because inflation is up by 2%. you're still losing money over time.. And again, this is not good.. Okay, so that begs the question. which is key point number two. which is how do we stop our money. from losing value over time?. And the answer is that. if we had a hypothetical savings account. one that was let's say\n",
      "an interest rate of 2.5%. that would match roughly\n",
      "the rate of inflation.. So inflation means\n",
      "everything goes up by 2.5%. in terms of price.. But our money in our savings account. also goes up by 2.5% each year.. Therefore we're technically\n",
      "not losing money over time.. If you're watching this\n",
      "and you have an issue. with the word interest, don't\n",
      "worry stick to it for now,. investment is not the same as interest. but we'll come back to that a bit later.. But the point here is that. we don't just want to not lose money. which is what happens at our 2.5% rate.. We actually want to make money.. And that brings us on\n",
      "to question number three. which is, well, how do\n",
      "we actually make money?. Now, let's go back to our\n",
      "hypothetical savings account.. If hypothetically, we could\n",
      "have a savings account. that was giving us a 10% interest rate. this will never happen because\n",
      "that's just way too high.. But hypothetically if it did,. that means that every\n",
      "year we'd be making 10%. of the value of the money\n",
      "in our savings account.. So for example, if I were\n",
      "to put a hundred pounds. in a savings account right now. the next year it would be worth 110.. And then the year after it will be 121. because it's 10% of then the 110,. and then it would be 130 something.. And this would very\n",
      "quickly compound so that. in 10 years time, my 100 pounds\n",
      "will have become 259 pounds.. And if we adjust for inflation. that our money is still worth\n",
      "206 pounds in 10 years time,. this is pretty good.. We have more than doubled our money,. by just putting it. in this hypothetical 10%\n",
      "interest savings account.. And it really doesn't\n",
      "seem like it would do that. because 10% feels like\n",
      "a small amount of money.. But if you extrapolate 10% over 10 years. you actually double your\n",
      "money, which is pretty awesome.. Sadly these hypothetical\n",
      "10% saving accounts. don't really exist, because\n",
      "it's just way too high. and real life is not that nice.. These days, most savings\n",
      "accounts in the UK. and I imagine around the\n",
      "rest of the world as well,. offer less than a 1% savings rate,. which means you're actually\n",
      "still losing money over time.. But we do have other options to try. and get us to this magical\n",
      "Nirvana of like, you know,. this 10% saving thingy.. And that is where investments come in.. So point number four is\n",
      "what is an investment?. And the answer is that an investment. is something that puts\n",
      "money in your pocket.. For example, let's say you buy a house. for a hundred 1000 pounds. and you want to rent it out to people.. There are two ways, that's an investment.. There are two ways you're\n",
      "making money from it.. Firstly, let's say\n",
      "you're charging some rent. to the people living in your house.. Let's say you're charging\n",
      "them 830 pounds a month.. That becomes 10,000 pounds a year.. And so every year you're\n",
      "making 10,000 pounds. in rental income, which is 10%. of what you originally paid for the house.. That means that in 10 years time. you'll have paid off the a\n",
      "100,000 pounds that you've put in. because you're making 10K a year.. And beyond that every year\n",
      "you're just making 10,000 pounds. in pure profit.. So that's pretty good.. But secondly, it's an investment. because the value of the house itself. would probably rise over time.. In general, there is a trend\n",
      "in most developed countries. that house prices tend to\n",
      "rise over the longterm.. And so your house will probably be worth. more than a hundred thousand\n",
      "pounds in 10 years time.. And in fact in the UK,\n",
      "historically in the past,. some people have said that house prices. have doubled every 10 years.. So maybe your house is worth\n",
      "close to 200,000 pounds.. And so you've made money\n",
      "off of the rental income. but you've also made money\n",
      "off of the capital gains. which is what we call it. when an asset increases\n",
      "in value over time.. But the problem is that. buying a house is a little bit annoying.. You need to have quite\n",
      "a large amount of money. for a deposit.. You need to get a mortgage.. You need to actually have the house.. You just sought out the rental management,. rent it out to people,\n",
      "all that kind of stuff.. If only there were a way of investing. without a, having a large\n",
      "amount of money to start with. and b, without having\n",
      "to put that much effort. into managing the assets as well.. And that brings us on\n",
      "to investing in shares.. And for me, basically, a hundred percent. of my investment portfolio\n",
      "is entirely shares.. I have a tiny percentage in\n",
      "Bitcoin and I own this house. but I don't consider\n",
      "this house an investment.. I'll talk about that in a different video.. Therefore number five is what are shares. and how do they work?. So buying shares probably as close. as we're ever gonna get. to this magical savings account. that just returns some\n",
      "amount of money each year.. And the idea is that when you buy a share,. you are buying a part ownership. of the company that\n",
      "you've got the share in.. For example, let's say the Apple. have a particularly profitable year. because lots of people have well iPads. as per my recommendations. and because Apple are feeling kind,. they are choosing to pay out a dividend. to their shareholders.. So for example they might say that. they're gonna issue a\n",
      "dividend of a million pounds,. and that's gonna be split evenly. amongst whoever owns shares in Apple,. based on how many shares they own.. So for example, if you\n",
      "happen to own 1% of Apple. you would get 1% of that\n",
      "dividend that they've issued.. So 1% of a million pounds,\n",
      "which is 10,000 pounds. obviously no one watching this\n",
      "actually owns 1% of Apple,. unless Tim Cook, you're watching,. I don't even know if you own that much. because that would make you\n",
      "an extremely rich person. because Apple is a very valuable company. but that's basically how\n",
      "the dividend thing works.. A company decides to issue a dividend. as a way of returning\n",
      "some of its profit back. to the people who have\n",
      "invested in the company.. And therefore you make\n",
      "money through dividends.. The second way of making money from shares. is sort of like with houses. in that you get the\n",
      "capital gains over time.. So for example, let's say\n",
      "you bought 10 shares in Apple. in 2010, at the time those\n",
      "shares were selling for $9 each.. So yoU.S.pent $90 on\n",
      "buying 10 shares in Apple.. As of October, 2020, Apple\n",
      "shares sell for $115.. So your 10 shares are now\n",
      "worth $1,150 just by the fact. that you only paid $90\n",
      "for them 10 years ago.. Okay, so we've talked\n",
      "about what a share is. and how you make money from them.. And at this point you've\n",
      "probably got a few questions. like how much money\n",
      "you need to get started. or how risky is buying\n",
      "shares in a company.. And I promise we're gonna get to that.. But point number six is how\n",
      "the hell do you buy a share. in the first place?. And this is where it can\n",
      "kind of get complicated. because it's not as simple\n",
      "as going on apple.com/buy. and just buying a share in Apple.. It doesn't quite work like that.. Instead you have to go through,\n",
      "what's called a broker.. And back in the day, a\n",
      "stockbroker was a physical person. usually a dude who you\n",
      "would call on the phone. and say \"Hey, Bob, I\n",
      "want to place an order. for some shares in Apple.\". And then Bob would types\n",
      "and stuff into his computer. or a place like a paper order.. And then you would own shares in Apple.. Thankfully these days we don't\n",
      "really have to talk to Bob. because there's loads and loads\n",
      "of online brokers instead.. And so you make an account\n",
      "on an online broker. and then you can buy shares\n",
      "in a company through that.. A bit annoyingly, every different country. has their own different brokers. that operate in that country.. Because to be an online\n",
      "broker in a country. you have to abide by like\n",
      "a zillion different laws.. And so in the UK the system\n",
      "is different to the U.S.. which is different to Canada\n",
      "and Germany and so on.. And the UK, for example, most banks. do have their own online\n",
      "brokerage type things.. So with most bank accounts. you can also open an investment account. with them and then invest online.. But usually the interface is a bit clunky.. It's a bit old fashioned.. And so you're usually better off going. with an online broker.. In the UK, the two that I use\n",
      "are Charles Stanley Direct. and Vanguard, but before\n",
      "we get ahead of ourselves. and make an account on\n",
      "Vanguard or whatever,. we need to understand a few more things.. And so question number seven is. how the hell do I decide\n",
      "which shares to buy?. And the easy answer to that. is that you actually\n",
      "don't want to figure out. which shares to buy.. You do not want to buy individual shares.. And I'm gonna tell you a\n",
      "little bit more about that. once I've had a haircut,\n",
      "so see you shortly.. All right?. So new hair, I've got\n",
      "my Invisalign braces on.. So I'm gonna sound a little bit different. but where were we?. Oh yeah, we were talking\n",
      "about why it's not a good idea. generally speaking to\n",
      "invest in individual stocks.. And I'm gonna do a video\n",
      "about this some other time,. but essentially the issue with investing. in individual stocks\n",
      "is it's kind of risky.. Like, yes, if you invest\n",
      "in something like Apple,. chances are it's gonna be\n",
      "around 10 years from now.. But historically there've\n",
      "been quite a few companies. that people were like, \"Oh\n",
      "my God, this is amazing.. This is the thing to invest in.\". And then that company went bust.. So you're automatically\n",
      "exposing yourself to more risk. if you're investing in individual stock,. also in general, like it's easy to say,. hey, Amazon grew 10X in the last 10 years.. Therefore it's gonna\n",
      "continue to do the same. for the next 10 years.. But that's trying to predict the future.. And the past is no real\n",
      "indication of future performance.. And so the advice. that most people would give for beginners. is that you should not\n",
      "invest in individual stocks.. You should invest in index funds.. And this is what Graham Stephan,. one of my favorite\n",
      "YouTubers also says as well.. He says, \"The index funds\n",
      "are the best, safest,. and easiest longterm investment\n",
      "strategy for most people.\". Which begs the question\n",
      "point number eight,. what the hell is an index fund?. So there's basically two\n",
      "bits to understand here. there's the index bit and the fund bit,. let's start with the fund bit.. And a fund is basically where. investors will pool their money,. so multiple investors would\n",
      "invest in the same fund.. And then that fund would\n",
      "have a fund manager.. And the fund manager\n",
      "decides which companies. the fund is gonna invest in.. For example, let's say\n",
      "I were managing a fund. and I called it Gringotts and\n",
      "let's say a hundred people. from my audience decided to\n",
      "invest in my Gringotts fund.. I as the fund manager can\n",
      "say, okay, the Gringotts fund. now that we have a hundred people's money. let's say it's a 100 million.. So everyone's invested 1 million each. I've now got a 100 million.. I'm gonna put 20% of that\n",
      "in Apple, 10% in Facebook,. 10% in Amazon, 10% in\n",
      "Tesla, 10% of Netflix. 10% in Johnson and Johnson,\n",
      "all of that sort of stuff.. And so you, the investor\n",
      "don't have to worry about this. because you trust me and my fund Gringotts. to manage your money.. And as you know, the fund performs well,. because the prices of these\n",
      "stocks and shares increases. you get the returns and I take\n",
      "a 1% or 2% management fee.. So I make a load of money. because I'm earning 1% or\n",
      "2% off of this a 100 million. that I'm managing and you're not worrying. about having to pick stocks yourself.. You trust me as a seasoned\n",
      "professional to do that for you.. So that's what a fund is.. Now, the index bit refers\n",
      "to a stock market index.. And so a stock market index. would for example, be the FTSE 100. which is the a hundred\n",
      "biggest companies in the UK. or the S&P 500, which is\n",
      "the 500 biggest companies. in the U.S. or the NASDAQ or the Dow.. And these are all different\n",
      "indices of the stock market.. And if we use the S&P 500, for example,. these are the components of the S&P 500.. So we said, it's the 500\n",
      "biggest companies in the U.S.. So number one is Apple and\n",
      "Apple makes up 6.5% of the S&P,. Microsoft makes up 5.5,\n",
      "Amazon makes it 4.7,. Facebook has 2.2, Alphabet,\n",
      "which is a Google makes 1.5. and 1.5 is about 3% of the total S&P 500.. And essentially we've\n",
      "got these 500 companies. if you go all the way down.... Oh, Ralph Lauren is 496,. but chances are, you've not really heard. of many of the other ones\n",
      "at the bottom of the list. but chances are, you've heard\n",
      "of most of the companies. towards the top of the list.. So the S&P 500 is an index\n",
      "of the U.S. stock market.. And if you look at the performance. as a whole of the S&P 500,\n",
      "you get a general idea. of how the U.S. economy\n",
      "is going as a whole.. So this is currently what\n",
      "the S&P 500 looks like. and if we do a five year time horizon,. in fact, let's go max.. So you can see the S&P\n",
      "500 started in 1980.. And since that time. this is what the us stock\n",
      "market has been doing.. So as you can see, there\n",
      "is a general trend upwards. but for example in 2000,\n",
      "there was a bit of a crash,. in 2008 famously there\n",
      "was a bit of a crash.. And earlier this year, when\n",
      "Corona was first starting. to be a thing there was a bit of a crash. but then the market basically. immediately recovered after that.. Okay, so we know what a fund is,. i.e. a way of pooling money.. And we know what the index is,\n",
      "something like the S&P 500,. when you combine those,\n",
      "you get an index fund. which is a fund that automatically invests. in all of the companies in the index.. And so with me, for example. basically all of my\n",
      "investments, all of my money. is in the S&P 500, which effectively means. that 6.5% of my investments\n",
      "are in Apple, 5.5 in Microsoft,. 4.7 in Amazon, 2.2 in\n",
      "Facebook, 3% in Google,. 1.5 in Berkshire Hathaway and so on.. So why is this good?. Well, it's good for a lot of reasons.. So firstly index funds are\n",
      "really, really easy to invest in.. A big problem that\n",
      "beginners have to investing,. it's like, well, how the hell. do I know which company to invest in?. How do I read a balance sheet?. How do I do any of this stuff?. If you invest in an index fund,. you actually don't have to\n",
      "worry about any of that.. Secondly, index funds give you. a decent amount of diversification.. There are all sorts of\n",
      "companies in the S&P 500.. So you're not entirely reliant. on the tech sector or the oil\n",
      "sector or the clothing sector. or anything to make\n",
      "the bulk of your money.. You are very nicely diversified. across all these U.S. companies.. Thirdly, index funds have very low fees.. So because it's not a real\n",
      "person who is deciding. what to invest in and\n",
      "doing all this research. and trying to make loads of money. is essentially a computer algorithm. that automatically allocate your money. based on the components of the index fund.. The fees for those are really low.. And one of the main things\n",
      "about investing for the longterm. is that even a slight\n",
      "increase in your fees. is gonna massively impact\n",
      "your financial upside.. And so for example, an\n",
      "index fund with a 0.1% fee. is so much better for you. than an actively managed fund. where a fund manager\n",
      "is charging you even 1%. because the longterm\n",
      "difference between 0.1% fees. and a 1% fee is sort of\n",
      "absolutely astronomical. over the long term.. And finally, if you look historically. and, you know technically\n",
      "historical performance. is not the same thing\n",
      "as future performance,. but if you look historically. very few funds have managed. to actually consistently beat the market. i.e. outperform the index.. And in fact, someone like\n",
      "Warren Buffet famously says. that if you gave him a\n",
      "hundred thousand pounds. and asked him to invest it right now. he would just invest in an\n",
      "index fund, like the S&P 500.. And in fact, in 2008 Warren Buffet. challenged the hedge fund industry. to try and beat the market.. He said that hedge funds\n",
      "are a bit pointless. because they charge way too high fees. and they don't actually\n",
      "get the sort of returns. they claim to get.. And so he set up this 10 year bet. which this company called\n",
      "Protege Partners LLC accepted,. where Buffett said that he was gonna bet. that the index fund outperformed\n",
      "the actively managed fund.. And he ended up winning that bet. and sort of gave lots of money for charity. or something like that.. But that just sort of goes to show that. it's really hard to beat the market. with an actively managed fund.. Basically, no one can predict. what the market is gonna do in the future.. And therefore if you\n",
      "hit your ride on index,. i.e. you're gambling on the entire market,. rather than thinking, you know what. I've got some amazing insight. that I'll know exactly\n",
      "which 10 stocks to pick. that are gonna beat the market.. You might as well hit your\n",
      "ride with the whole market. rather than individual stocks.. Okay, so we've sorted out the problem. of which stocks to invest in. by completely circumventing the problem. and instead, just\n",
      "investing in index funds.. The next big question people usually have. about investing in stocks and\n",
      "shares is the amount of risk.. And that brings us to point number nine.. And the argument usually\n",
      "goes as follows that,. \"Hey, okay cool.. This investing in stocks and shares stuff.. It sounds kind of interesting,. but my uncle Tom Cobley,. invested lots of money\n",
      "in the stock market.. And he lost a lot of money.. And my parents have told me. that investing in the stock\n",
      "market is a really risky thing. and I shouldn't do it.. And I should instead invest in real estate. because real estate is safe.\". That is usually the sort of thing,. the sort of idea that people\n",
      "have about investing in stocks.. And naturally there is the anxiety. of what if I lose all my money.. So let's talk about that now.. So if we take a step back,. the only way to lose money in anything. is if you buy a thing and then you sell it. for less than you actually bought it.. Like, let's say you bought\n",
      "a house for 300,000 pounds,. and then Brexit happens the next day. and the house prices plummet.. And now your house is only worth 250,000.. At that point, if you\n",
      "decide to sell your house,. then yes you are losing money. and you've lost 50,000 pounds.. Equally, the only way to\n",
      "really lose money in stocks. is if you buy a stock at a certain price. and then you sell it for\n",
      "less than that price.. So for example, let's say\n",
      "you bought shares in Apple. on the 18th of February, 2020.. And let's say you bought one share. which time was $79 and 75 cents.. And because this is your\n",
      "first time in investing. you keep on looking at the\n",
      "price of the Apple stock. because every time are you thinking,. oh, have I made money, have I made money?. And really annoyingly for you,. you see that over the\n",
      "next kind of few days. a few weeks, Apple stock\n",
      "is actually going down.. And then on the 18th of March,\n",
      "2020, you decide screw it.. I'm gonna sell my one share on Apple,. because I don't want to lose all my money.. And you sell it for a\n",
      "measly price of $61.67.. And so you technically lost $18. because you bought it at $79 in February,. and you've sold it for $61 in March.. Then you think, damn, I've\n",
      "lost 20% of my investment.. This stock market thing is BS.. I'm never gonna invest in\n",
      "the stock market again,. and you call it a day.. And this would be a very bad thing to do.. Because for example, if we\n",
      "look at Apple stock price. in March, it was $57.31. but if you just held\n",
      "onto your one Apple share. in that time, what is it today?. It's the 8th of October.. Apple is now trading at $114.96.. So if you just held on for a few months,. you would actually made a lot of money.. You would have bought it at\n",
      "$79 and within, I don't know. eight months, it would now be worth $115.. That's a pretty good game.. And so the real lesson here is that. when you're investing\n",
      "in stocks and shares,. and also when you're\n",
      "investing in real estate,. these are longterm investments.. Ideally, you shouldn't\n",
      "be putting any money. into stocks and shares. that you need to access\n",
      "within the next five years.. And actually a lot of people\n",
      "would extend that to 10 years.. And it's exactly like\n",
      "that with house prices,. it's like if you buy a\n",
      "house as an investment,. and then the houses house prices go down. it would be completely stupid of you. to sell the house unless\n",
      "you are absolutely desperate. for the money, because\n",
      "something major has happened.. And instead, if you\n",
      "just held onto the house. then you would have made\n",
      "more money in the long run. because in the longterm\n",
      "house prices always go up. and in the longterm basically. the stock market always goes up. and that's a bit of, it can\n",
      "be a controversial statement.. It is true, but I'm gonna make a video. at some other point\n",
      "explaining why it's true. but for now take my word for\n",
      "it that over the long term,. the stock market always goes up.. But having said that again,\n",
      "this is a longterm thing.. And so, for example, if\n",
      "we look at the S&P 500. and look at how it was in\n",
      "2008 at the financial crash. right in 2007, it's $1,500\n",
      "per bit of the S&P 500.. And then the crash happens\n",
      "and then by what is it?. February, 2009, it's down to 735.. So basically 50% of the\n",
      "value has been wiped off. of the S&P 500.. Now, if you bought it in 2007\n",

      "are you one of the 60 million americans. actively using a 401k plan to save for. retirement how do you know that's the. right choice for you. despite their immense popularity 401k. plans aren't the standard for all. retirement accounts iras or individual. retirement accounts are the most popular. choice for those saving for retirement. accounting for more than a third of all. u.s retirement assets. the ira provides a lot of autonomy and. opportunity to invest in things that you. feel are fit or work better for you. first introduced in 1974 iras have seen. explosive growth over the last five. decades individual retirement accounts. totaled an estimated 12.6 trillion. dollars in assets during the first. quarter of 2021 compared to just 2.6. trillion dollars back in 2000. in our research we've been able to see. that the people who use the ira to make. contributions do so year over year over. year but an ira isn't the only account. that future retirees should look out for. more and more americans have been taking. advantage of their hsa or health savings. account to supplement their retirement. savings despite the fact that the. account was never intended to be used. for that purpose. contributions. similar to traditional 401ks or iras. they go in pre-tax but unlike. traditional 401ks and iras they're also. not taxed upon withdrawal if you're. using it for qualified medical expense. choosing the right retirement account. that best suits your needs is a vital. step in making sure you are well. prepared for retirement so how do these. alternative retirement accounts operate. and which retirement plan will be best. for you when it comes to choosing a. retirement account that's best for you. it all comes down to what financial. situation you're currently in but most. experts agree that employer-sponsored. accounts should be utilized whenever. possible these include 401k and 403b. plans which are retirement accounts. dedicated specifically for employees of. public schools employees of tax-exempt. organizations and certain ministers when. thinking about the first best place to. save for retirement for most people that. will actually be their 401k or 403p plan. at work. and the reason is 9 out of 10. participants are in plans where the. employer makes contributions i think. 401ks are. great because typically they have lower. fees. than. other retirement accounts and especially. if your company is offering a match. then 401ks are the way to go iras are. best for self-employed individuals and. employers or employees who are not. offered a 401k due to its limited. matching and lower contribution limit in. 2021 401k plans had a contribution limit. of nineteen thousand five hundred. dollars a year for employees younger. than fifty. while ira contribution limits were. strictly set at six thousand dollars. that goes back to what they were. originally designed for right so the. goal was to enable those without an. employer sponsor plan to save a. tax-severed fashion and typically people. who are higher income working for large. companies their company is going to. offer a 401k so it's striking the. balance between allowing people to save. for retirement and offering them that. tax advantage. while also making sure that this isn't. just a tax shelter for the very wealthy. if you don't have a plan at work the ira. has all the tax advantages of the plan. at work and you fund it yourself so it's. your contributions it will go in there. won't be any employer money in a. traditional or a roth it'll be your. contributions going in but it's a great. way for you to. get those tax advantages that the folks. are getting in the employer sponsored. plans meanwhile financial advisors warn. hsas should only be used to supplement. your main retirement savings hsa should. definitely not be a replacement for a. 401k or an ira if you have a high. deductible health insurance plan then. hsas are great for setting aside money. in case of medical expense to make the. most of your retirement accounts you. first need to understand how all the. different plans work so traditional iras. were first introduced as a part of arusa. back in 1974 and the goal was to really. enable those without an. employer-sponsored plan to save in a. tax-deferred way. and so although eligibility initially. was to those without pensions it. eventually expanded to those with. employer sponsor plans in the 1980s iras. were also designed to play another vital. role in our retirement market. consolidation of rollovers when people. change jobs and they don't want to keep. the balance in their 401k with their old. employer then they'll transfer it over. to an ira because that is attached to. them directly and rollovers have played. a major role in fueling the growth of. iras in mid-2020 more than half of all. traditional ira owning households had. accounts containing some amount of. rollovers from their previous employment. if you think about all the folks who. change jobs in any given year or who are. retiring and who want to consolidate. that money into one spot. put it into an ira a whole lot of the. growth is because of those rollovers. coming into the ira space so it's sort. of a place to park retirement assets as. well as a place to drive some real. retirement saving ira holders enjoy a. wide array of benefits that are unique. to their account for instance like the. 401k most iras have a 10 penalty for any. early withdrawal before the age of 59. and a half but iras can give an. exception to certain expenses such as. higher education health insurance if you. are unemployed and up to ten thousand. dollars for a first home purchase but. its biggest advantage over any other. retirement account is its wide selection. of investment options with the ira you. have. exposure to. the public marketplace fully right so. you can. own etfs mutual funds individual stocks. so i think that the popularity of the. ira is that it does offer a place to. build a retirement nest egg that has the. tax advantages of a plan iras come in. numerous different types but the most. popular comes down to these four. traditional roth sep and simple ira each. one comes with its own set of rules. as the industry evolved and you have. different types of workers doing. different types of things and that need. different deferred vehicles you've seen. the sep ira created you've seen the. simple ira created so retirement. industry has evolved quite a bit over. the last 25 years to kind of meet what. the market demand is traditional iras. are the oldest and most common type of. individual retirement account. in 2020 36.8 million u.s households or. 28.6 percent owned a traditional ira you. can contribute cash and receive a tax. deduction in return if you qualify. the money inside the account is tax. deferred meaning you can delay paying. taxes on the amount until a later date. while there technically isn't an income. limit for contribution how much. deduction you are eligible for depends. heavily on whether you are already. covered by a retirement plan at work a. full deduction is only allowed if you. and your spouse if you're married aren't. covered by a retirement plan at work if. you or your spouse is covered then your. deduction eligibility depends on how. much income you make if you're eligible. for a deductible contribution you can. save on your tax bill this year. once the money is in that traditional. ira it compounds so think of all those. reinvested earnings and capital gains. all just getting plowed back into the. account without any taxes. and then when you get to retirement and. start taking the money out it gets. counted as income because you're now. finally taking that income that you put. aside and taking it out in retirement so. you can live on it and that's when you. pay taxes on it roth iras are the second. most frequently owned type of ira held. by 26.3 million u.s households or 20.5. percent the major difference between the. traditional and roth is when the owner. is responsible for paying taxes on their. contribution. the roth ira is a little bit different. where you're taking after tax money. it grows tax free. and then as long as you hold it for. more than five years. and your retirement after 59 and a half. you could pull those assets tax free so. if you think if you're young right now. you think that you're going to be in a. high wage trajectory and so in the. future your your taxes are going to be. higher then it might also be beneficial. to have a roth now sep and simple iras. are two employer-sponsored plans. reserved for small businesses and. self-employed individuals in 2020 8.6. million or 6.7 percent of u.s households. owned some sort of an employer-sponsored. ira plan they were designed to allow. small employers to provide retirement. account without having to. deal with the administrative burden of. providing a plan but second simple areas. are kind of in a different category from. roth and traditional iras they have. different income limits and they have. requirements on employer size the major. difference between sep and simple iras. lies in who can make the contributions. for sep iras it's generally the. employers who make the contributions for. themselves as well as their employees. but for simple iras both the employer. and the employee can make the. contributions the employer however is. generally required to match the. employee's contributions up to three. percent of the employee's compensation. or at least one percent for no more than. two out of five years. the simple is restricted to small. employers so fewer than 100 participants. and the idea there was that it would be. easier for the employer to set up an ira. for their workers. rather than a full-blown 401k plan and. so the employer makes contributions it's. an ira the individuals choose the. investments within the account and it. pretty much is like an employer. sponsored plan basically for people but. in an ira structure there's a laundry. list of different types suitable for. every financial situation for instance. self-directed iras can include. investments such as real estate private. company shares and even cryptocurrency. iras definitely do offer a self-directed. option when she can add in real estate. and i'm sure a lot of people have heard. the stories of some. multi-billionaires who have you know a. large amount of money in their iras that. could not have come from contributions. alone i think what's so important here. is to do an assessment and to really. kind of understand what do you need this. tool for what are you trying to solve. for and then ultimately figure out. what's the best plan that works for you. if you think about retirement savings. plans such as 401ks and iras probably. come to mind but there are other. unexpected ways a working individual can. save for retirement a health savings. account is one of them i'm just as. puzzled as you in terms of why hsas. became another option for a retirement. account i don't think they were designed. to be a retirement account first. introduced in 2003 hsas were originally. created to incentivize saving for. medical expenses for those with a high. deductible plan i think it's been born. out of folks with high premium costs. health insurance has gotten expensive so. i think you've seen a lot of. participants move to these high. deductible plans that are a little bit. cheaper the. idea is that you can put money pre-tax. into hsa and set that aside so in the. event that you need to spend money on. your health care that would not be. covered by your insurance plan the ones. that i've seen that have been most. popular. are for folks that are getting close to. retirement let's say 10 years out that. are planning for their time and said hey. listen i want to defer. some assets for potential health care. costs down the road and then they retire. you know they get their medicare or. medicaid or whatever it might be in. their part b their supplementary plan. and then on top of it they have an hsa. plan. that really makes sure they take care of. all their health care needs what makes. hsa such an effective tool for. retirement isn't just the tax deduction. but the fact that funds can be withdrawn. at any time for health expenses however. once you've enrolled in medicare you. can't contribute to an hsa you still. have access to the funds already put. aside but you can't add more. unlike traditional 401ks and iras. they're also not taxed upon withdrawal. if you're using it for a qualified. medical expense so the plus side is that. you're kind of getting a lot of tax. benefits the downside is it only works. if you're using it for medical expense. however a majority of hsa holders are. using their accounts to cover their. expenses rather than using it to save. for retirement despite the fact that an. hsa balance can also be used to invest. just seven percent of health savings. accounts in 2019 held investments other. than cash think about this i've deferred. dollar for dollar ten thousand dollars. into my hsa over five years. and that ten thousand dollars has been. invested into a portfolio that has now. grown to fifteen thousand dollars you've. had the capital appreciation of five. grand because your cost basis was ten. now you have 15 000 available to you to. take care of medical expenses so it's. not a dollar for dollar i think folks. miss the investment component that's a. major deal and being able to provide for. health care expenses there's certainly a. lot of different types of. retirement accounts it is important to. understand the options especially at the. employer sponsored options you have. available just because it's the best way. to build up nest egg for retirement is. to start saving early the biden. administration is expected to propose. several changes to the current. retirement plan options. during his campaign president biden. called for an overhaul of 401k tax. breaks that tend to skew towards higher. income families by equalizing the tax. benefits of retirement plans he also. proposed the creation of automatic 401ks. that would provide workers without a. pension or a 401k type plan a chance to. easily save for retirement at work. despite these changes retirement. accounts will continue to grow as more. americans realize the importance of. saving for retirement. i think that really in looking at the. u.s retirement system. it's a system that is really. accumulating we've got 35 trillion. dollars earmarked for retirement and we. are going to continue contributing and. building that system so that people will. have those nest eggs when they get to. retirement to rely on\n",

      "what's up you guys it's Graham here so. let's cover one of my favorite ways to. invest ever besides real estate and I. would even go so far as to say that this. is the best safest and easiest long-term. investment strategy out there for most. people and also this is the investment. strategy that requires very little work. no skill needed and still has some of. the best returns out there and even more. surprising what if I told you that this. investment outperform 99% of individual. investors and almost 95% of hedge funds. and this is something you can do with. about 20 minutes of your time and yes I. know that you know what I'm already. talking about here based on the title of. the video but let's drum up a little bit. of suspense because talking about. Vanguard index funds so let's go over. exactly what an index fund is how it. works and how you can set this up. yourself in a matter of minutes to. profit long term and maybe one day get. like lambo rich or like yacht rich or. buy private islands or whatever you want. anyway index funds but really quick I do. just want to mention that this video is. not sponsored by Vanguard I had no. financial incentive if you use them or. not I don't have any affiliate links to. Vanguard if you buy their funds or if. you don't decide to buy their funds I. have no financial affiliation with. Vanguard whatsoever. I just happen to think this is a great. topic to talk about I truly believe in. this strategy long term I do it myself. and also I have a lot of data and. research the backs of everything that I. talk about so all I ask in return is if. you guys enjoy videos and topics like. this to go ahead and gently tap that. like button it helps up the channel. tremendously if you do that so it just. takes one fraction of a second to go. ahead and do that that's it and enjoy. the video so first of all let's start. here what exactly is an index fund an. index fund is really just a group of. investments that you could put your. money into and then you own a percentage. of the entire thing here's an example. imagine if I owned a thousand apartment. buildings in there each worth one. thousand dollars I go to you and I say I. will sell you one of my buildings for. $1000 that would almost be like the. equivalent of you going and buying one. stock of one individual company but the. problem here is that now you only have. one apartment building or one investment. and what happens. if that investment doesn't do very well. or maybe that one company you invested. in has a CEO who loves to talk on. Twitter and he ends up saying some. stupid stuff that gets him in trouble. with the SEC and that company doesn't do. very well in the short term how do you. prevent something like this well here's. the solution to this imagine in my. previous example where I gave you a. scenario where instead of investing a. thousand dollars and you buy one of my. thousand apartment buildings imagine if. you could invest $1,000 and then you get. 0.1% of everything that I own so you're. a small percentage owner in all of my. apartment buildings this way you get an. averaged return based off everything. that I own this is basically an index. fund for example you can own all of the. top 500 publicly traded companies here. in the United States for the low price. of just about 260 dollars this way. you're not just buying one stock in one. company but instead you're buying. literally all of them and also with. index funds you can do this with pretty. much any market out there if you want to. own a small portion of pretty much every. single international stock out there. well you can do that from the low price. of just twenty eight dollars where you. can own a small portion of the entire US. stock market for the low price of just. seventy dollars and it doesn't stop. there because there are index funds for. pretty much any single market out there. like you want to invest in bonds well. here you go or if you want to buy a. whole bunch of real estate but you don't. want to get just one REIT well vnq. offers all of this with a whole bunch of. office buildings and hotels your money. ends up going a very long way when you. start doing this but that thin lens the. question why exactly does this make such. a good investment and also why haven't. you already smashed that like button if. you didn't do that earlier all right so. let's start here the biggest advantage. with index funds is that they have very. low fees that's because these indexes. are very simple to put together they're. very simple to manage there isn't much. overhead and all of those savings get. passed on to you as the investor and. this is what's known as a passively. managed fund you're buying into an. entire portfolio of stocks that. automatically gets balanced and adjusted. over time without doing any work and. paying as low as 0.03 to 0.04 percent. annually to do so. is the total opposite of what's called a. mutual fund and this is a fund that. employs professional stock pickers who. buy and sell stocks over time to try to. beat the market average however all of. the additional overhead expenses. associated with doing this as well as. all the fees associated with buying and. selling ultimately get passed on to you. as the investor in the form of much. higher fees and all of that is without. the guarantee of actually beating the. market in the first place and speaking. of that when you compare the performance. between the two both index funds and. mutual funds it's found that only 22% of. actively traded funds have actually beat. the market over a ten-year period that. was it only 22% actually achieved that. result so that means that in 78% of. situations you're better off and would. have made more money just investing in. an index fund over ten years. the second advantage with doing this is. that for most investors out there they. will make more money investing in an. index fund than they would investing in. individual stocks on their own several. studies have shown that over 92 to 95. percent of portfolio managers could not. outperform the market index over a 15. year period and keep in mind that these. are people who are the brightest in. their field who have gone to Ivy League. schools with a really deep understanding. of economics and finance who do this. full-time daily and not even they can. outperform just the market index and. those figures are so so so much worse. for the average individual investor a. big reason for that is that many. investors tend to trade emotionally and. panic when the market drops then they. try to time the market or they jump in a. stock as it's going up for fear of. missing out and it's because of that. that usually correlates to much lower. than average returns and also in an. interview in 2017 Warren Buffett went so. far as to say that attempting to pick. times to buy and sell stocks is a. mistake for 99% of the population Warren. Buffett even went so far as to bet a. collection of hedge fund managers. $1,000,000 that they couldn't beat the. market over a ten-year period and. outperform an index fund literally a. standard Vanguard index fund outperform. the best hedge fund managers in the. entire world for a million-dollar bet. and if the wealthiest living person. right now is telling all of us to go and. buy index funds then I have a feeling. that is something we should probably. listen to the third advantage of going. and buying index funds is to have a huge. amount of diversification like even if. you have 20 individual stocks in your. stock portfolio if one of those goes. down and fails you can end up losing a. lot of money on the other hand if you go. and buy the entire S&P 500 index funds. you have 500 different stocks and. different companies that weight your. overall return and even if one of those. fails it doesn't really matter because. you have 499 others to boost you up this. means that having a few individual. companies go up or down in the markets. in the short term won't really affect. your overall return because you're. betting long term that the market will. rise overall as a whole and also doing. this as an investor will give you a lot. more market stability because let's be. real most people can't handle the market. volatility and as soon as they see it go. down they panic and they freak out and. they sell it and then they see it going. back up and they buy back in because. it's going back up now and they don't. want to miss at all the money they can't. handle any sort of market volatility so. just by virtue of that and recognizing. the human tendency that we tend to freak. out over the smallest things and panic. and get emotional an index fund would. solve most of those issues and forth the. reason I invest in index funds is my. only other investment besides real. estate is because it takes no time to do. and it's easy I just love the simplicity. of it I also fully acknowledge that I am. NOT a stock market expert I cannot buy. and sell stocks that will consistently. beat the market long term nor do I want. to spend all of that time reading stock. charts reading news and reading earnings. reports that would allow me to make. those types of decisions and even if I. took all the time to do that and I. really dedicated myself to trading. stocks and trying to beat the market if. 95% of hedge fund managers the most. skilled people in the world cannot. consistently beat the market long-term. what makes me think that I can I know my. limitations and I will just work around. that so instead I will just invest in. the entire. get sit back relax and focus my time on. other areas that will make me even more. money than I can reinvest back into the. markets and I would even go so far as to. say that for most people watching they. would be best off just investing in an. index fund to get the highest overall. return long time and I got to say that. by doing this it is so much less. stressful it's literally just a buy it. and forget about it mentality there is. no panicking in the middle of the night. worried about like earnings reports. tomorrow there is no worries about like. SEC allegations or companies going down. or profits falling this this no worries. whatsoever for me I just know that index. funds are my second largest investment. besides real estate and I have no. concern that long-term overall the. market will be trending up alright so. with that out of the way what's the best. way to go about doing this and also. which are the best investments for you. to buy now my favorite index fund. investing method is what's called the. three fund portfolio this is also one of. the most popular index fund investing. strategies that like I said earlier. beats 99% of individual investors. long-term over a 10-year period and as. the name suggests it obviously consists. of three funds obviously funds number. one is a US stock market index fund. number two is an international stock. market index and fun number three is a. bond market index and that is it this. gives you the broadest diversification. at the absolute cheapest cost and is. going to give you the highest returns. overall from just about almost anything. else that you can do in your own and not. only that but because you're investing. in multiple asset classes you have three. almost uncorrelated markets that you. have your money into so that way if. something happens to one you have two. others that would balance that out so. how easy is this then to do well here. are three funds that Vanguard has that. would basically be the entire portfolio. first you have US stocks and that would. be the Vanguard total stock market index. fund. vt sacks then you have international. stocks with the Vanguard total. international index fund VIX and then. you also have bonds the Vanguard total. bond market index fund V blue. it's a good vivix vivix Alexis it's. Vivat Alex that's that's what it is. now with this in terms of how much and. which to buy it really depends on how. close you are to retirement the general. rule of thumb when it comes to this is. that the further you are from retirement. the more aggressive you could be with. your portfolio which means the more. stocks that you should have likewise if. you're closer to retirement the less. aggressive your portfolio should be the. less risk you should take and therefore. the more bonds you should have so this. means if you're anything like me and. you're in your 20s or 30s chances are. you would be fine with seventy to ninety. percent in stocks and then 10 to 30% in. bonds and then just buy it and hold that. for 30 to 40 years that also gives you. the best chance to recover in any sort. of market drop in the short term because. you know that over the long term it's. going to be going up in value over time. and also if you're a few years away from. retirement it might be a good idea to go. like 80 to 85 percent bonds and then. maybe 20 to 15% in stocks so that way. you have a much safer stable return in. retirement when you need the money now. when it comes to me personally I am. putting seventy percent in US stocks 20. percent in international stocks and then. 10 percent in bonds and then I'm. planning to hold all of this and. contribute to it regularly over the next. 30 years without changing it up without. doing a single thing it just by hold. reinvest hold buy more holds keep. holding. keep holding keep buying more and then. holding that's it and like I said for. most people this would have the highest. returns of just about anything you can. do yourself in the stock market long. term overall on average that means that. I won't get people in the comment. section being like well this is bad. advantage because I bought Amazon 15. years ago and now it's worth 10 million. dollars so that's really bad advice. Graham my stocks are up 50% this year. I'm just saying long-term consistently. long-term I'm not talking about the few. people who got really lucky with stocks. or the 1% that was able to do this. successfully long term I'm talking. overall to the 99% of people watching. this. right now and even though with me real. estate has been my number one investment. over the last ten years I still invest. in index funds because they totally. recognize the benefit the. diversification and the stability of. doing this long-term for a relatively. low cost but then what about when it. comes to market timing since we're. nearing all-time highs again does this. mean it's a bad time to invest or is. this a good time to invest from what do. I think when it comes to this and this. is probably one of the most common. comments that I get anytime I talk about. the stock market and thankfully this is. a relatively easy one to answer the. truth is that no one can accurately and. consistently predict what the market is. going to be doing in the short term it. wasn't even two months ago that the. market was crashing the bull run was. over everyone should sell everything and. hold cash and then buy back in at the. dip and then like two months later we've. almost entirely recovered and everyone. is taking back what they said and like. oh well no the market isn't really. crashing it's it's it's actually I never. said that so with that said there have. been dozens if not hundreds of studies. that have been done on this that proved. that time in the market beats timing the. market in the majority of situations and. a study done by Charles Schwab they. found that in 74% of situations you're. better off investing immediately and. holding for twenty years then you aren't. trying to time the lowest point of the. market and then riding the wave no one. could predict what the market is going. to be in the short term so why even try. instead I just invest whenever I have. the money with the expectation of. holding it one to two decades and I will. come out ahead now in terms of actually. doing this it is really just as simple. as going to Vanguard calm opening an. account typing in your checking accounts. information and then you're pretty much. good to go within like 20 minutes and. all you need to do after that is just. keep buying the same investments over. and over and over again and expect to. grow your wealth at the same rate as the. entire stock market even though I made. this video specifically about Vanguard. index funds there are other brokerages. out there that you can feel free to use. as well fidelity happens to be a very. good example of another company that I. would love to use besides Vanguard so. the answer is no you do not need to. invest with Vanguard but if you decide. to go elsewhere at least make sure that. their fees are on par or lower than. Vanguard so that way you're not leaving. extra money on the table and that's. pretty much it that's all you have to do. it's really easy it's really basic it's. really simple and that strategy will be. 99% of individual investors out there. for a very low cost I mean it's really. just there's nothing not to like about. this so with that said you guys thank. you so much for watching I really. appreciate it if you guys made to the. very end you haven't already subscribed. yet make sure to subscribe I post three. videos a week so if you want to stay. tuned with that make sure to hit that. subscribe button also feel free to add. me on Instagram I post it pretty much. daily so if you want to be a part of it. there feel free to add me there thank. you again for watching and until next. time\n",

      "the name's bond municipal bond. let's um let's start this video over. bonds are some of the most necessary and. fundamental vehicles in the financial. sector. they allow towns governments companies. and other groups to get funding. bonds are essentially just ious to the. person giving you money. the lender that says you're going to pay. them back sometime in the future. they're a fancy form of a loan that gets. companies and governments funding when. they. need it what makes bonds different from. loans is that they're a form of a. security. in that you can buy a bond and start. getting payments from the company that. owes you. in essence bonds are securitized loans. bonds will typically include an end date. in their terms when the entire amount of. money is due back to the issuer. as well as terms for the interest. payments to be made. these are some core principles about. bonds to remember if you're looking for. a general overview. [Music]. [Applause]. they're corporate or government debt. issued by an organization that are. tradable assets in the form of. securities. bonds are stable and referred to as a. fixed. income instrument their payments to. holders don't fluctuate over time like. the value of stocks or dividend payouts. due. bond prices inversely correlate with. interest rates. since a low interest rate usually means. the borrower is trustworthy. more people will want to own that bond. because there's little risk. conversely high interest rates infer a. risky borrower which. increases the chance that a bond will. become worthless thus making them. cheaper bonds have dates at which point. all of their value must be paid back. this is called the maturity date and. beyond this point the bond. ceases to exist. [Music]. like we mentioned before bonds are a way. for companies or governments to raise. money without. giving up ownership of their company. which is what selling stock would do. if a government needed money for a. project they could issue bonds. which investors can buy and be. guaranteed payments by the government. government bonds are typically seen as. safe because there's little chance the. government. won't pay back the funds companies on. the other hand. go bankrupt far more often which would. mean any bonds they issued would become. worthless if companies like apple issued. a bond. investors would eat it up because it. would be seen as a very safe investment. however if a company like blockbuster. issued a bond to raise. funds to open up a new store it would be. a pretty risky bond. you might be asking yourself though why. wouldn't a company just go to a bank and. get a loan. well chances are the bank can't loan. them the amount of money they need. in this case companies have to turn to. selling bonds to raise more capital. bonds provide a way for individual. investors and funds to become lenders to. massive companies. think of it almost as a way of. crowdfunding corporate or government. debt. finding one bank to give you 20 million. dollars might be. hard but finding 20 000 people to give. you 1 000. would be a lot easier now that we've. covered why bonds exist and who. issues them let's talk about the. specifics of how they work. [Music]. bonds are a form of security just like. stocks. except bonds are generally more secure. and offer payments over time. and have an end date which is how. investors make their money. rather than buying the stock at one. price and selling it higher. later bonds can be traded publicly or. privately depending upon the way that. they're set up. while you might buy a bond in a similar. way as a stock. the difference is that bonds will come. with terms and a plan for how you're. going to get your money back. bonds will include the terms of the loan. the interest payments to be made over. time. and the maturity date the time at which. the entirety of the funds need to be. paid back. to investors bondholders make their. money through interest payments the. company makes to them. on top of paying back the original loan. interest payments are called the coupon. and the interest rate is called the. coupon rate. most bonds are usually priced at either. one hundred or. one thousand dollars called the par. value. however prices can fluctuate as people. buy and sell them. if a company issues a bond when their. financials look good. but then something like say a pandemic. happens. and the company loses all their revenue. sources the bond would fall in value as. people wouldn't want to own it. however since the bond was already sold. to investors in this case it would be. the investors who lose their money. not the company who issued the bond this. is the same way stocks and other. securities work. it's the risk of investing the value of. a bond depends on these main factors. credit quality of the issuer date until. maturity. and the coupon rate compared to the. average interest rate of other bonds. you could buy a bond and never plan to. hold it until maturity. rather you could buy a bond to just flip. it a few weeks later if the price went. up conversely you could also just buy. bonds and let them. sit collecting interest over time and. making your money back slowly. let's go through some more specific. principles of bonds. face value is the amount of money the. bond is worth at maturity. a face value of 1 000 would mean that at. the maturity date the issuing company. would have to pay you back. the full 1000 the coupon rate is the. interest rate. which the issuer will pay a five percent. rate on a one thousand dollar. face value would mean that you'd get. fifty dollars per year in addition to. the one thousand dollars at maturity. coupon dates are the dates when interest. payments will be made. the maturity date is the end date of the. bond. and finally the issue price is the. initial price the issuer set to buy the. bond from them the major determinants of. quality of a bond are the credit quality. of the company or government. like a corporate credit score and the. time to maturity. if the issuer has bad credit the risk of. losing. all of the bond's value is greater. making the interest rate be higher in. order for investors to be willing to. take the risk. if the maturity date is further out the. interest rate will usually be higher too. since it will take a longer time to get. back the initial. investment companies get credit ratings. from credit ratings agencies like. moody's and standards and poors. side note these companies were also one. of the main reasons for the 2008. financial collapse. something we talked about in our video. on mortgage-backed securities. linked right here bonds that are stable. are called investment grade bonds. these are typically u.s government bonds. and strong profitable companies. bonds that are risky are called. high-yield bonds or junk bonds. these bonds have a greater risk of. losing all of their value. which means they'll pay out a higher. interest rate but you could lose. everything if the company goes bankrupt. [Music]. main categories of bonds are corporate. bonds which are bonds from companies. municipal bonds which are bonds from. states or cities. government bonds which are bonds issued. by a national bank. or government and agency bonds which are. issued by. organizations that are affiliated with. governments. there are also unique bond structures. different from what we initially talked. about. those are zero coupon bonds which are. bonds that don't pay interest but are. rather sold at a discount and paid out. in full at the end of the term. for example you could buy a one thousand. dollar face value bond for nine hundred. dollars. and in five years get back the full one. thousand dollars. convertible bonds are another type which. can be converted into stock. down the line depending upon the stock. price this allows companies to pay less. interest to the bond holders. that are willing to get stock of the. company down the line instead of a. higher interest rate over time. for example a normal bond might have a. 12. interest rate and a convertible bond. might have an eight percent interest. rate. with the ability to be converted into. stock if the stock hits a certain price. down the line. it's less payments for the company up. front and could be an attractive risk. to the bond buyer there's also callable. bonds. which are bonds that a company can buy. back if they determine they can get a. better interest rate down the line. say their credit rating improves and. interest rates decline. the company could buy back the bond and. reissue the bond at a lower rate. finally there's putable bonds these. bonds allow the holders to sell the bond. back to the company before maturity. which is a way for investors to protect. themselves if they're worried about the. company not paying. up down the line lastly let's talk about. how bonds are priced. bonds prices fluctuate just like any. other security on the market. just like if a company starts doing. really well their stock price might go. up. so might their bond price if a company. starts losing a ton of money their stock. price might go down. so too might their bond price all of it. is a matter of supply and demand. what investors are willing to pay and. what somebody's willing to sell it for. in reality though there's a variety of. technical factors that go into pricing. bonds. that we won't really delve into in this. video at the end of the day. bonds are just loans to borrowers that. individual investors hold. not big banks necessarily they can be. fantastically stable investments that. should make up part of your investing. portfolio. they can also be radically risky. investments that can make or break you. bonds are at the center of the way our. modern economy functions. and understanding how they work is. crucial to understanding. investing\n",
      "in early 2020 the S P 500 Index reached. its local high on February 19th just. over a month later the market dropped 34. from that high as the market reacted. strongly to the onset of the pandemic. had you bought at the absolute bottom. your gains would have been well over 65. percent by the end of 2020. this. prompted many investors to ask. themselves can you make money by timing. the bottom of the market. there are tons of articles on the. subject and most people will tell you. that time in the market eats timing the. market when it comes to investing I went. a little bit further and looked up a few. different studies on the matter and the. most recent one in 2019 the results are. eye-opening the study looked at a period. from January 1st 2009 to December 31st. 2018 and hypothetically if you invested. ten thousand dollars into the S P 500 it. found that if you had left the money. invested for the entire 10 years your. thousand dollars would have become. 2775 dollars by the end of it so. basically that's a 2.7 x on your initial. investment but by just missing 10 of the. best days of the 10-year period your. investment would have only increased to. 1722 dollars by the end of 10 years. that's basically showing you that if you. miss some of the best days your returns. are incredibly capped and in this. specific case you would have lost out on. a thousand dollars now if you had missed. 30 days this is pretty crazy your. investment would have only been 918. dollars after investing the initial 1000. so that means you would have lost money. on your investment so time and again if. you stay invested for the long term and. you're able to capture those best days. of the market those are going to be the. days that contribute the most to your. overall returns in your portfolio the. point of sharing this study is that we. as investors should be investing for the. long term and not selling off all of our. investments when Market volatility. appears in today's video I'm going to. share with you guys how to build a. bulletproof portfolio for 2023 because a. lot of things are changing in 2023 with. the rising of interest rates monetary. policy is getting tighter as well as the. fear of a possible recession the. portfolio framework I would like to. share with you guys today is one that's. more focused on a conservative strategy. with a long-term mindset in mind which. means that it's going to help you. capture some upside and accumulate your. wealth it's been updated for 2023 and. it's important to note that this video. is generally tailored to my audience. which is someone between the ages of 18. and 40 years old and that you have. somewhat of a steady salary if you are. older than 40 years old or maybe even. closer to retirement you might want to. assess what you your risk tolerance is. and see if you can alter this portfolio. in any way to better fit your needs if. you are on the older side and you're not. too sure how to allocate your portfolio. or shift your risk around or even what. your needs are I'm going to leave some. links Down Below in the description for. you guys so that you can check that out. after this video and hopefully that. provides you a good methodology moving. forward all right so moving on into the. actual portfolio one thing I'm. prioritizing in 2023 above all else is. actually going to be cash I'm personally. looking to start 2023 with at least 30. percent of my portfolio in cash and. that's actually a big increase from the. previous year where I only had a 10. allocation to cash the reason I want. cash more this year than compared to. last year is pretty simple there's a lot. of uncertainty in the market especially. with what the FED is going to do we know. that the FED is trying to increase rates. through the first half of 2023 which. means that money is going to be a lot. tighter than before so by having some. cash in my portfolio what I'm able to do. is I'm able to sit on that cache and. wait for opportunities in the market to. arise I'm also going to sit on that. cache until the FED has made it clear. that they're going to stop these. interest rate hikes and as soon as they. stop or pause or even signal that there. will be no more interest rate hikes or. even maybe interest rate Cuts that's. when I'm going to start deploying the. cash more now I don't have a crystal. ball which means that you could have. more cash than me or you could have a. little bit less cash than me and again. the old adage still applies which is. time in the market beats timing the. market so if you didn't want to have. that much cash and you wanted to be. deployed in the market for the very very. long term I see no problem with that. either now at the beginning of this. video I did say that this portfolio was. going to be rather conservative and. that's the overall investment philosophy. of this portfolio which is to be. long-term minded aggressive in the right. spots but conservative elsewhere and. that's basically why I have this 30 cash. position all right so now let's get into. the fun stuff which is what the actual. portfolio is made up of in terms of. Investments the next biggest chunk of my. investable assets is going to be in ETFs. or exchange traded funds these are the. foundation to my portfolio or any. portfolio in my opinion and they're. basically going to plug and chug at an. average rate of return of around 7 to 10. every single year now when I say seven. to ten percent a year on average that. doesn't mean every single year you're. gonna get eight percent eight percent. nine percent Etc some year is going to. be up 23 and other years you might. actually be down a little bit of money. the point is is that if you stay. invested in an ETF over a long period of. time especially one that tracks the S P. 500 Market it typically averages about. seven to ten percent and if you're. sitting there and you're like okay what. is an ETF and what does it actually do. an ETF is just one fund that you buy and. by buying that one fund you get access. to everything that it invests in so with. an ETF like ticker symbol vo that tracks. the S P 500 by investing ten thousand. dollars into vo you get a small. percentage of the 511 stocks that it. owns other ETFs you can invest into are. like ticker symbol vti which is the. entire U.S stock market or there are. other sector-specific ETFs like energy. ETFs or real estate ETFs for my ETF. allocation for 2023 I'd like to see 40. of My overall portfolio into ETFs so for. example if I had a ten thousand dollar. portfolio four thousand of those dollars. would be in ETFs the next allocation. that I would like in my portfolio are. actually going to be individual Blue. Chip stocks these are your Googles your. ibms your Johnson and Johnson's your. apples and your Amazons of the world. that means these are super large. capitalization stocks which means that. their market cap is worth well into the. hundreds of billions of dollars these. are the stocks that are going to remain. stable over a long period of time and. generally when you're thinking about a. blue chip stock you should think to. yourself hey will this company still be. around in 20 to 40 years from now a blue. chip stock generally has an excellent. reputation pays a dividend even. sometimes and has a reputation for good. earnings if you were to filter all the. stocks from a market capitalization. standpoint I would probably look at. stocks well over a hundred billion. dollars in market cap so that means no. penny stocks and definitely no meme. stocks so for example AMC Theaters has a. market cap of around four billion. dollars I am not even touching that with. a 10-foot Pole now compare AMC to a. company like American Express American. Express has a market cap of around a 114. billion dollars at the time of this. recording which means that Amex is worth. at least 28 times more than AMC to give. you guys some examples of some other. companies in the 100 billion dollar and. up range those could include a t that's. worth around 135 billion dollars. Salesforce worth worth about uh 150. billion dollars ups at 158 billion. dollars and McDonald's at 200 billion. dollars you get the idea these are going. to be companies that complement your. ETFs and also anchor your portfolio and. allow you to capture some upside more. than just the traditional Market Apple. for example has been killing it in the. past five years up around 240 percent in. the past five years and Home Depot is up. 86 percent just to give an example if. you are going to pick some Blue Chip. stocks you want to definitely do your. due diligence so don't just basically. blindly pick a blue chip stock like. Google or Apple you want to make sure. you look into their balance sheet make. sure it looks healthy you want to make. sure they're earning profits still and. you want to make sure that the. management team is solid if you want to. figure out how to do that step by step I. do have video where I show you how I. pick stocks I'll link that down below. and maybe appear all right so for this. allocation I'm putting 20 of My overall. portfolio into blue chip stock so that. means if my portfolio was worth ten. thousand dollars like in our earlier. example I would have two thousand of. those dollars allocated to buying. different types of Blue Chip stocks all. right so if you're still with me right. now that means of our total portfolio. we've already gone over 90 of it which. means we're almost done yes but that. means it's 20 Blue Chips thirty percent. cash and forty percent into ETFs that. gives us a total of ninety percent but. what do we do with that last ten percent. this last ten percent in my opinion is a. little bit more flexible depending on. your age so if you're on the younger. side I would actually lean towards. growth stocks and more speculative. stocks versus if you're on the older. side I'm probably leaning more towards. fixed income AKA bonds now you're. probably wondering why only 10 into. growth stocks so let's talk about this. scenario first well growth stocks tend. to suffer in higher interest rate. environments because that means it's. going to cost more to borrow money since. a lot of growth stocks are unprofitable. and and they highly leverage debt and. borrowing that means as interest rates. go up the cost to borrow increases so if. a company is coming back on their growth. or is less profitable that means they. are going to have less in free cash flow. and that's a large reason or large. Factor on how growth stocks are actually. valued which means the stock price will. tend to drop if you do want to have some. growth stocks in your portfolio I would. probably make sure that one you're under. the age of 40. number two that you get. an understanding of what the company is. and what exactly it does the third thing. I look at is their finances and their. path to profitability you want to make. sure that they actually have one and. then lastly last but not least you want. to make sure that they actually have a. demand for their product and that their. product is actually going to still stick. around even through the next recession. in terms of bonds the 10-year treasury. right now is yielding closer to four. percent and you're going to find a lot. of more fixed income products closer to. this number so if you are on the older. side and you desire some more of that. fixed income and more stability in your. portfolio then you can put this 10. allocation into bonds instead of growth. stocks now that's not to say if you're. younger you you shouldn't try bonds. either if you have more of a. conservative risk tolerance so basically. you don't have an appetite for risk like. many other young people might have then. perhaps you stick more of your portfolio. into bonds again this portfolio is not a. one-size-fits all it's more just a mere. suggestion on what I would do if I was. between the ages of 18 and 40 and had a. pretty stable salary alright so this is. just a sample portfolio of ten thousand. dollars and as you can see in column B. we have all the ticker symbols right. here you can see in row 13 that we have. cash and of our cash position we have. three thousand dollars of it in cash or. 30 percent then if we look up at row. number four that's our ticker symbol vo. that's the Vanguard 500 S P 500 Index. ETF and of that I have 40 of my. portfolio invested into that I have two. growth stocks invested in this portfolio. Tesla and Shopify now you could argue. that Tesla is a pretty big company and. is no longer a growth stock however it. is a very volatile stock so that's kind. of why I still categorize it as kind of. growthy now in terms of my blue chip. stocks I only chose six you can. definitely have more more Blue Chip. stocks but I have a wide range of. sectors so I have financials with JP. Morgan Chase I have Tech with apple I. have some consumer with McDonald's and. Home Depot and then some more financial. companies like Bank of America and. American Express I probably could have. chosen some other Blue Chip stocks. perhaps in energy like Exxon. um that would be one that I could add in. there if I wanted to but for this sake. of this example I just have these six. you can see in this table right here. that the exact allocations I have are. pretty close I know that the Blue Chip. stocks the value should be actually be 2. 000 so it's it's off by a dollar or two. and that has to do with the Google sheet. itself but feel free to take a. screenshot right here I'm also going to. share this portfolio Link in the. description below so that you can copy. it or even just use it for your. reference basically when you're creating. your portfolio you want to write down. everything that you want to buy before. you buy it or before you allocate into. it so having a sheet like this is pretty. helpful this is personally what I'm. going to be doing in 2023 I'm going to. try to get my portfolio as close to this. as possible I know it's a little bit. more conservative but we're really not. too sure what's going to happen in 2023. with the rising interest rate. environment and quantitative tightening. if your portfolio is still 100 in growth. stocks I would probably re-look at that. because in the event that the market. does not do great in 2023 a portfolio. that's more closer to this one might be. a little bit more reasonable in terms of. your returns all right make sure to. subscribe if you found this video. helpful and I'll see you guys in the. next one peace\n",
      "what's up you guys it's Graham here so. this video is really meant to be a. real-estate beginner tutorial where I. can really cover the basics and outline. the blueprints of exactly what's needed. in order to prepare for and actually. invest in real estate with this I'm. going to try to keep it as basic and. step-by-step and non complicated as. possible and believe it or not with this. video this is something that you can. begin working on today it's that easy as. soon as you finish this video so I. highly encourage anyone who's watching. now to actually go and utilize these. techniques start as soon as possible in. that way in the future. you're gonna be in a great position to. actually go and utilize all of these. techniques to their fullest extent and. with that you will make money so just as. some clarification here what I mean. investing in real estate I'm not talking. about wholesaling I'm not talking about. flipping I'm talking about actually. owning a property as an investment where. you then get a tenant in there who pays. your mortgage down for you while. hopefully still providing a little. profit on top of that long term and then. fifteen to thirty years from now you. will end up owning that home out rights. you will own it free and clear you will. start making a lot of rental income and. with that you can pretty much just chill. and do whatever the you want and. that you guys is the entire point of. investing in real estate now step one. and this is something I realize I say so. often in my videos but the reason I do. this is because repetitiveness actually. works because people either don't pay. attention they forget they put it off. and it keeps me saying this over and. over and over again for it to sink in. and that you guys is simply just. building your credit score and they. pretty much have a million bajillion. videos I've already made exactly on this. topic so I will just link to them down. in the description but basically you. need a good credit score because lenders. look at that anytime they determine what. sort of loan they're going to give you. and in what interest rate the higher the. score the lower the interest rate you. pay and with that the more money you get. in your pocket every single month and. when you have a bad credit score at. lenders either look at you and say you. know what we're not even gonna let you. because you don't have a good credit. score because you didn't watch Graham's. videos or if they're gonna look at you. and say yeah we can charge you a really. high interest rate if you want that loan. and that makes me very very sad so. literally just not paying attention to. this step and not bill. your credit will cost you a lot of money. over your lifetime and this is one of. these steps you can start immediately. after watching this video so as soon as. you're finished watching the video and. after you've hit the like button on this. video because you've enjoyed it. hopefully go in the description click. the video about credit cards just watch. that and then click the like button on. that one and then begin building your. credit now the second step is to go and. save your money the reality is that you. can't really invest in real estate with. no money down with no credit with salary. finance it just it doesn't really exist. those are unicorn anomaly deals that I. have never myself seen firsthand in the. last ten years of me doing real estate. and probably 999 out of a thousand deals. out there you will need to put down. anywhere between 5% and 20% of the. purchase price have the income to. actually get the loan and have the. credit score to get the loan at a good. interest rate so this means that in. order to actually save money not only. will you be required to live frugally so. that you could save the money that you. make but you're gonna have to actually. make money now I know this seems just. super common sense like notion gram you. got you got to make money but believe me. I get probably five to ten messages a. day from people who ask how can I invest. in real estate with no money down with. no credit with no job how do I do this. and the answer is that doesn't exist you. will actually need to go and make money. to then invest and in terms of actually. making money that's really up to you to. decide how you want to go about that. maybe you want to take the steady. nine-to-five and get the guaranteed. paycheck every other week just so you. could be able to qualify for a loan. nothing wrong with that or you can start. your own business and then try to make a. little bit more money and speed up the. process the choice is really up to you. as long as you actually make and can. actually save money now the third step. here is to actually show your income on. a tax return this means that you can't. just go and have one phenomenal month on. Shopify and then expect to use that. income as a down payment and then invest. in real estate just a few months later. lenders really want to see a consistent. stable long-term source of income before. they end up giving you a loan this is to. prevent people from getting a loan based. off maybe just a few phenomenal. that are unlikely to happen again or. also to avoid high-risk borrowers that. might not be able to make the payments. after a few months and then default. after the first year so in order to do. this you're gonna be needing to show. proof of income on the last one to two. years of your tax returns for me because. I'm self-employed they look at my last. two years of tax returns they take the. average of the income between those two. years and based my loan on that now for. salaried employees oftentimes banks will. look at the last one year of your tax. returns and often the last six months of. your bank statements and then base your. loan off of that but it's really. important to any time you're showing. income on a tax return to not go too. heavy with tax write-offs because. lenders often look at your net income. after all of your expenses now I made. this mistake in 2014 when I went really. aggressive on my tax write-offs I. basically tried to write off as much as. I could to lower my tax obligation but. in 2016 lenders saw my 2014 tax return. they saw all the write offs and they saw. that year was lower in net income than. the subsequent years simply because I. wrote off so much and they lowered the. amount I was able to qualify for because. that one year brought down my average. now thankfully this wasn't a big deal. because the property ended up buying was. within my price range regardless but. this could have been devastating had the. property I wanted to buy was more money. and with that it would require me to. show more income that I might not have. had so what I do to get around this is. that before I file my tax return I. talked to a lender I will have the. lender look over my tax return before I. file it with the state in order for them. to determine whether or not the income. I'm showing is sufficient for the loan I. want to get this works out amazingly. well because oftentimes if I'm showing. too much income I'm overpaying on my. taxes and I can write off a little bit. more but if I'm not showing enough. income I could simply ease off my tax. write-offs and be okay to get the loan I. want to get and then with that final. number what I usually do is give myself. an extra 10% buffer on my tax write-offs. that way it can show a little bit more. income just in case interest rates go up. I can qualify for the slightly higher. payment now the fourth step with this is. to actually get pre-qualified with a. lender and this is such an important. step and. step will save you from a lot of. disappointment what always ends up. happening for the people that don't get. prequalified as they go out they start. looking and they find the perfect spot. they fall in love with it it's amazing. but it's slightly outside what they can. afford and they can't buy it then. everything else they see after that they. compared to that one deal that's. obviously more expensive and a higher. price point that they couldn't afford. and every deal in comparison to that. just looks like crap so just save. yourself the heartache and the. frustration and the wasted time by just. speaking with a lender first it's really. as easy as going to a few different. banks having them run your credit giving. them your tax returns and bank. statements and anything else they need. and they will pre approve you for a loan. based off that information you can then. go and take that rate sheet and go shop. it around in other banks who will run. the same information they will require. pretty much the same things and they. will often beat that loan of the first. place and then you just keep shopping. them around against each other until you. end up getting the best rate possible. now the advantage here of having. multiple banks approve you for a loan is. really two reasons the first one is just. having the security in the event the. first bank can't perform and giving you. your loan and second is you often just. get the lowest price possible on the. loan you get now a lot of people are. worried that by going to different banks. and having them run your credit it's. gonna dramatically lower your credit. score and this is false any time a. lender runs your credit anything within. a 30 to 60 day window after that is. grouped all as one inquiry this is to. encourage rate shopping so that. customers get the lowest price possible. so running your credit score at ten. times is going to have the exact same. impact on your credit as simply just. running it once now as an example on. this working first hand on the last deal. I got I got approved by three banks and. was intending to move forward with Chase. until last minute one of their. appraisals came in low for rental income. and they wanted to give me a slightly. lower loan amount so I ended up going. with my backup option which was the. exact same rate same everything except. their appraisal came in much higher and. I was able to get a much higher loan. amount this saved me from wasting a lot. of time because I had already done this. work ahead of time I already shopped. around the loans and with this I was. really able to get the best. and best loan possible so with this step. five is to really do your research and. see everything on the market in the area. that you want to buy in find out which. areas you feel are undervalued and. poised to go up in price for me I invest. in areas that are just outside of other. areas that have dramatically gone up in. price and seen a lot of dune development. for instance if I see one areas going up. in price massively but if you drive five. minutes away it's like half the price I. invest five minutes away because I feel. like most people will eventually be out. priced of those areas and want to move. just further outside of those areas. where it's a lot cheaper and more. affordable and that in turn will end up. driving prices up there and then it just. continues to expand outward so in order. to notice this and see this just be. really really good at being able to. notice what's going on in your market. drive around all the areas and see where. new restaurants are going in see where. new hotels are going and see where new. apartment buildings are going in see. where things are just generally. improving and prices are increasing and. then just drive a few minutes away from. that also grow and see every single open. house you possibly can on Saturdays and. Sundays the more you see the more. references you have so that when you. actually see a good deal you know it the. more you see the more you know and the. more you know the better you're able to. invest and spot the best deals without. doing this and without seeing a ton of. properties you're really gonna have no. idea what you're looking at because you. simply have nothing else to compare it. to and ideally you'll want to find. something that just needs a little bit. of love just some really light cosmetic. work maybe the kitchen just looks like. crap or maybe the bathroom is just old. maybe the landscaping just sucks maybe. the paint is all spilling off you want. to find some really easy lights cosmetic. upgrades that you can probably do in one. to two months maximum there aren't too. complicated that most contractors could. easily do and these make the best. remodels and these often have the best. ROI once you get into redoing. foundations and rearranging floor plans. and adding square footage and all that. stuff it just becomes a lot more. expensive time-consuming and riskier to. make your money back on especially as a. beginner I don't recommend this if. you're just starting out now step six is. make offers on places you think are a. good. deal it's really important with this. that you know your price you know what. the home is worth and you've had the. patience to wait until you find that. deal even for me it took me about six. months to find the place I ended up. buying and I lost out on maybe four or. five offers because they had the. patience I knew what the properties were. worth and I didn't want to over spend on. something that I didn't feel was 100%. worth it. and also when I bought my first three. properties in 2011-2012 I probably wrote. close to a hundred offers on places and. just low-balled everybody until I found. a few that actually went and accepted my. offer just have the patience to really. take your time with this and do not get. caught up in the emotional rollercoaster. of competing and multiple offers to the. point where you will overpay for. something that's just not worth it. however don't be stubborn don't be an. idiot and look at this with a long-term. outlook over the next 20 or 30 years. overpaying by a few thousand dollars to. get the absolutely perfect property is. going to be worth it you're not gonna. look back thirty years from now and be. like I only spent five grand in that. property it wasn't worth it no if. overspending by a few thousand dollars. is going to get you the perfect place. then otherwise you're gonna have to. spend another year of looking to find. something similar to that where maybe. the market went up five percent and all. of a sudden that few grand you spend is. nothing go ahead and overspend on that. property buy a few thousand dollars. knowing that in the bigger picture it's. going to be worth it don't be penny wise. dollar foolish to pass up otherwise the. perfect deal just because you get. stubborn with it and think you're this. you and think that another deal will. just magically pop up a few days later. it's more important to find the right. property at a fair price than it is to. wait years potentially to find the. unicorn of a deal that you could buy at. a steal because those deals rarely ever. come up and oftentimes people lose. hundreds of thousands of dollars just. waiting around for those deals to come. up and they don't exist trust me I have. seen this firsthand as a real estate. agent. I've seen people wait years to find the. perfect place and in the process the. market goes up 50% and all of a sudden. they're priced out of all the homes they. were originally looking at that would. have worked amazingly well simply. because they wanted the perfect place at. the perfect price that didn't exist now. step 7 once you actually get your offer. accepted is to then do inspections. I recommend doing it as many inspections. as you possibly can just to get to know. what you're getting into and the. condition of the property I usually tell. my clients that these inspections are at. the very least a break-even from what. they're investing for instance if. they're spending $2,000 on inspections. at the very least usually you can get. $2,000 worth of repairs or credits to. compensate you for all the money that. you've spent I also take this a step. further and bring in one to two. contractors to give me actual bids of. what it's going to cost me to bring the. property up to date and fix any issues. the good news with this is that. oftentimes contractors will do this. entirely for free because they want your. business with this they actually give. you the first-hand experience of what's. actually needed what it's really going. to cost and with this you get your work. out of the way because you get bids in. escrow now combining the inspections. with the contractors I know everything. that's wrong with the property from both. a cosmetic standpoint and from a. functionality standpoint and with this I. could then go and negotiate the price. with the seller accordingly depending on. what's wrong with it what needs to be. upgraded and what I didn't anticipate. especially if your plan is to then go. and buy the property and remodel it it's. so important you get these estimates out. of the way early on so you know exactly. what this property is going to cost what. your ROI is and what the property is. going to be worth when you're done with. it now step number eight here is to. actually then close in your property in. the process of doing your inspections. and everything chances are you gonna be. speaking with your lender and giving. them information that they request from. your tax returns bank statements credits. and all that stuff I mentioned earlier. at the same time they're gonna be doing. an appraisal on the property to show the. bank that they're actually lending on a. property that's worth what you're. actually paying the process of closing. usually takes anywhere from as low as 20. days to as high as 45 days depending on. the type of property how involved it is. with the bank and how much work you did. ahead of time before getting your offer. accepted with the bank but once it. closes this is where the real fun begins. step 9 is starting to do your minor. cosmetic renovations this is where you. end up making instant equity because not. only are you buying an undervalued. property in an area that's poised to go. up in price but you're also buying a. property that needs some work where you. can add F. by simply fixing it up that's the. trifecta making money and real estate. right there now in addition to that. number four is that the more the home is. worth the more you can rent it out for. which means the more money in your. pocket now at this point most people ask. me Graham. where do you find your contractors at my. simple answer to this is two ways the. first one is word-of-mouth if I see. someone that remodeled the property I. simply ask him hey who ended up doing. this remodeling who is the contractor do. you mind if I get their contact. information most people are very happy. to give a good contractor more work. because it looks good on them and it. helps the contractor out and in turn. oftentimes the contractor will give the. first person cheaper prices in the. future because they know they're gonna. bring in more business that's number one. simply word-of-mouth just asked around. number two comes from Yelp anytime I. want to look up a different contractor I. simply type in the trade I need look on. Yelp and then look for people who have. really good reviews I then call them up. you get a few bids and few estimates. from a few different people and you pick. who you feel is going to be the best fit. this is honestly how I found my best. contractors so far it's word-of-mouth. and Yelp it's really that easy. and also people ask me how do I know how. much something should cost and the best. answer is simply by getting multiple. bids from multiple contractors getting. one bid from one contractor doesn't tell. you anything if you're totally. inexperienced you have no idea how much. something cost that's not gonna help you. need to get multiple bids and you'll be. able to see the differences in price and. more people come in about the same and. with this you can usually estimate okay. I think the drywall is gonna cost on. average this painting is going to cost. this you can also break it down by. material whereas let's say you're. painting materials are gonna be $500 and. they're charging you two thousand. dollars well this means they're charging. you fifteen hundred dollars in labor how. many people are gonna be there and how. long is it going to take with this you. can usually determine how much the. contractor is making and how much. they're paying their workers so yeah. there's a little bit of math there. you'll probably have to use your. calculator but the more you end up doing. this the better you get at doing this. and then pretty soon you're able to do. the second hand just by looking at. something and also one last piece of. advice is whatever estimate they give. you just always. at 15 to 20% more on top of that even. with the most honest contractors there. will always be things that crop up that. weren't anticipated you won't want to. change things you won't want to make. things better and upgrade things just. trust me on this one it's always 15 to. 20 percent more than what you think it's. actually going to cost. now finally step 10 assuming you've done. all the renovations you're hopefully on. budget is then going to find a tenant my. favorite way to then go and find a. tenant. I love Craigslist I have found. Craigslist is one of the best ways to. get tenants I get a ton of people asking. about my properties it's absolutely free. super easy to post on there and that. believe it or not is how I found the. majority of my tenants I also have a. video of what I do in terms of getting. leads on Craigslist I will link that. video down below in terms of the format. I use and everything on that it's really. easy it's a 20-minute video just. everything is down below in the. description but hopefully at this point. you've been rented the property out by. using my techniques on posting your ads. on Craigslist your positive cash flow. and now you're officially a real estate. investor who's making money every month. and then 15 to 30 years from now your. property's paid off you're ballin you're. living living the dream and and you make. sure you hit the like button so with. that said you guys thank you so much for. watching I really appreciate it if you. guys enjoy videos like this make sure. like I said just to hit the like button. if you watch it all the way through and. you're not already subscribed just make. sure to smash that subscribe button and. then smash the notification bells so you. can be part of the notification squad. where YouTube notifies you anytime I. upload a video also feel free to add me. on snapchat and Instagram and finally I. have a link in the description to a. private Facebook group for anybody who's. interested in real estate real estate. investing agent ding wholesaling just. anything real estate the link is in the. description so make sure to add yourself. to that thank you again for watching and. until next time\n",
      "hey y'all in today's video I'm going to. share with you seven dividend stocks. that pay me over 500 per month I've been. really getting into dividends this year. especially with the way that the market. has been trending we're seeing a. rotation out of tech stocks and into. more value stocks and stable companies. many of these stable companies will pay. a dividend and I really value the. passive income generated from owning. these dividend-paying stocks and if. you're looking to increase your own. passive income streams then dividend. stocks could be a good way to do that. okay before we get into the list let's. actually briefly explain why companies. pay dividends what you can expect from. dividends as well as some of the. pitfalls to look out for when it comes. to this this part is important so don't. skip it trust me you're going to want to. know this stuff and then after this. we'll get into the entire stock list so. why do companies pay dividends when. companies make a profit they need to do. something with that profit they usually. have a few different options number one. they could reinvest their money so for. example if you're a growing startup and. you earn some profit then you could. actually just reinvest that into your. business to create better products and. hopefully get more market share the. other thing that companies can do when. they make a profit is to pay some of. that profit back to their shareholders. in the form of a cash dividend payment. so just by owning a dividend-paying. stock you usually get paid a cash. payment dividend every quarter that's. the usual schedule and if you compound. these dividends over time the effects. can be pretty amazing now there are some. other things that companies can do with. their profits like share BuyBacks or. perhaps reducing the debt on their. balance sheet but for the most part what. we're focused on is the dividend now. back in the day I used to just look for. a company with the highest dividend. yields like over 10 percent and just. invest in that but you're going to want. to be a little bit careful of that. because that's what's known as a. dividend trap I think anything over a. five or six percent dividend yield. should be looked at a little bit closer. because that kind of tells you that. they're not reinvesting their money into. the business perhaps they're paying too. much out in dividends to their. shareholders or the company's stock. price has fallen so much that the. dividend now looks like a larger. percentage of their entire stock price. I'm not saying all high yielders are bad. stocks that's not what I'm saying at all. but anytime you see a dividend yield. over five or six percent you should do. some more more research all right so the. first stock in my portfolio that's a big. dividend paying company is JPMorgan. Chase this is one of the biggest. Financial companies out there and. they're paying right now a 3.4 to 3.5. percent dividend yield on their stock so. that means for every share of JP Morgan. that you own you're going to get paid. about four dollars annually for owning. that share yeah so 3.5 isn't really that. high of a yield per se but it is higher. than the Benchmark of the S P 500 which. is around 1.7 percent dividend yields. are overall just a lot lower than when I. started investing and that's due to the. share price going up because if the. share price keeps going up and the. dividend stays constant then as we know. the dividend yield will drop the reason. I like JP Morgan so much is that they. have a large amount of cash on their. balance sheet they basically have 1.7. trillion dollars in liquid assets which. over 700 billion of it is cash so that. means if you're a shareholder you're. going to feel pretty secure knowing that. JP Morgan isn't going to go bankrupt I. think JPMorgan is well positioned in the. financial sector especially with a. rising interest rate environment so as. you may or may not know the FED is about. to raise interest rates again this week. so as interest rates go up banks are. going to profit off of that because they. can basically Arbitrage the interest. rate and what they give to customers. this means that we should see net. interest income for JP Morgan continue. to go up especially throughout this year. and next year as the FED continues to. battle inflation they're probably going. to keep raising rates so if that happens. it'll just stand to benefit JP Morgan I. really value security when it comes to a. dividend-paying portfolio because if the. company's out of business then they're. not going to be paying you a dividend so. in the case of JP Morgan they did not go. bankrupt in 2008 like some other. financial institutions out there like. Lehman Brothers for example and you know. with so much cash on their balance sheet. that they're just not going to go. anywhere so for that reason I really. like having JP Morgan in my portfolio. Okay the next stock in my portfolio is. known as avvy and that's actually a. biopharmaceutical company that owns a. portfolio of drugs in different sectors. like oncology immunology and also. Neuroscience right now the stock. currently pays a 3.95 percent dividend. yield which amounts to about 5.64 cents. per share that you own every single year. that you own it you might not have heard. of Abby before but I guarantee that. you've probably seen a commercial for. their most notable drug which is. actually called Humira it's a drug that. reduces pain and swelling caused by. arthritis and so different types of. arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis even. Crohn's disease and other skin disorders. can be treated by Humira it also happens. to be one of the most successful drugs. ever it regularly tops the best-selling. drugs list every single year I know. that's crazy that that's even a list but. in 2019 the sales of Humira alone were. over 19 billion dollars for that single. drug now I know that this might be a. little controversial like you're. investing in Avi which is a. pharmaceutical company and the American. Health Care system is extremely broken. we all know that but Avi is well. positioned in their sector because they. have leading patents on a bunch of. different drugs as well as they continue. to invest in their research and. development programs which means that. they're going to be diversifying their. product mix as we move forward I I think. that this is going to give them a strong. economic moat and right now their. operating cash flow is huge it's 22.9. billion dollars every single year in the. most recent year as well as having Avi. in my portfolio is giving me some more. diversity to My overall stock Holdings. and also it's the only Healthcare Pharma. stock that I own so I'm pretty much okay. with it I don't really see them going. anywhere Now One Challenge they will. face is that they are losing exclusivity. with the Humira drug in 2023 which is. next year so that means there is going. to be more competition for that. particular space in the drug field. however I don't know if this is such a. big deal because they are investing so. much in r d but it's something to keep. track of and at 5.64 cents per share. that means it's going to scale pretty. well if you own 100 shares of ABV you're. going to get 564 dollars in dividends. every single year which is pretty. compelling now before we get into stock. three I wanted to tell you guys that. Weeble is giving away 12 free stocks as. a promotion I know that sounds. ridiculous but it's 12 free stocks when. you deposit at least one cent Weeble is. an app where you you can buy and sell. stocks and I personally use it on a. daily basis as of right now this is one. of the best stock promotions out there. across the entire industry so I would. definitely take advantage of it while. you can now I will leave the link in. description below and as long as the. link is in there that means the. promotion is so active so make sure to. go get those all right the third stock. on my list it's something that we're. probably all really familiar with it's. PepsiCo so PepsiCo sells different soft. drinks and beverages but they also own. Gatorade and Frito-Lay which is a. consumer package company that sells. different types of potato chips their. dividend right now is four dollars and. sixty cents for every share that you own. which means that you're going to be. getting about a dollar and fifteen cents. every quarter for every share that you. own and that results in a 2.73 dividend. yield which is pretty in line with JP. Morgan now you're probably wondering why. do you own Pepsi over Coke and that's. definitely a valid question because Coke. is a pretty comparable company with also. a very great dividend but in my opinion. I think I like Pepsi a little bit more. because of its diversification of its. product mix and if you really think. about it like Coke sells beverages which. is great but Pepsi does sell those. consumer package Goods like the chips. and it actually accounts for about 20 of. their revenue the last time I read their. financial report which is a really good. thing because if you're looking for more. growth then there's probably going to be. more growth opportunities for a company. that has a more diverse product mix. Pepsi is also one of those stocks where. it benefits them to have some pricing. power and basically they have pricing. power because consumers will always. demand their goods almost no matter what. as long as they're not raising the. prices too crazily but with the current. inflationary environment that we're in. if they can pass off some of those. inflationary costs to their customers. and their customers don't mind then I. think that's a pretty big win for Pepsi. another great thing about Pepsi is that. they're going to be here for probably. your entire lifetime and my entire. lifetime as well you know that Pepsi and. Coke have been Mainstays for quite a. long time and because they're so big and. so large and the demand for their. products is so good I don't think. they're going anywhere okay so stock. number four is craft Heinz Co you've. probably heard of Kraft Heinz before. they make all your favorite condiments. and and consumer food Staples such as. ketchup mustard mayonnaise and A1 steak. sauce not only do they make those. products they sell a ton of it with net. sales of 26 billion dollars just last. year they have a pretty strong dividend. with a 4.62 percent dividend yield which. comes out to around 1.60 per share that. you own this Stock's basically been. training flat the entire year which I. think is fine compared to the S P 500. which is down about 17 percent and it's. also a stock that Warren Buffett still. continues to hold in his portfolio today. I think it's always great to own a. company that relies on the consumer food. staple product as their main product. offering because food is not going. anywhere and even in tough Economic. Times people still have to eat so no. matter what their products are going to. be probably in demand now I will say out. of all the stocks in my portfolio I'm. going to keep a closer eye on Craft. Heinz Co and the reason is is that in. the past couple of years their profits. have been trending a little bit. downwards not by a ton by any means but. just by a couple percentage points it's. still something to keep in mind and the. the reason I think that's happening is. that oh there's a there's been this like. big shift away from like packaged and. like processed goods and people are. trying to eat healthier and so for a. company like craft Heinz Co that offers. a shelf life product this could be a. threat and that's just something I'm. going to keep in mind I'm not really. worried about the dividend of Kraft. Heinz Co however if things don't turn. around financially especially in the. next couple quarters or maybe the next. year I might let go of craft heinzko in. favor for a different allocation in my. portfolio all right pick number five is. another controversial pick but it's. actually Exxon Mobil it's controversial. because it's not necessarily a green. option and oil is not something. hopefully that we're still relying on in. the next 30 or 50 years but for now. fossil fuel dependency is still pretty. big and if you were to invest in Exxon. this year energy is actually one of. those sectors that has been. outperforming this year so it would have. probably benefited your portfolio quite. well if you did have this whole thing. refined oil products like petroleum. gasoline and heating oil products are. currently going for a premium on the. market and with the Ukraine Russia War. still going on and ends nowhere in sight. I don't anticipate Energy prices coming. down anytime soon Exxon right now is. raking in the profits and they pay their. shareholders a 3.78 dividend yield which. amounts to 3.52 cents per share per year. that you own them the other great thing. about Exxon this year specifically is. that they're up 50 year to date versus a. stock like Google which is actually down. 30 so as you can tell energy is doing. really well this year and Tech is. getting crushed Exxon also makes for a. really great inflation hedge because if. you look at any CPI reading the biggest. sector that always goes up in price is. energy so Exxon stands to benefit from. that and if you really think about the. entire supply chain as a whole oil is. used in almost everything from. delivering your food on trucks or maybe. even harvesting your crops with the. machines that they use I'm personally a. fan of their dividend and I think. holding Exxon as a diversification. measure in your portfolio is a good one. now there are some risks to Exxon as. well which is that governments are more. shifting towards green energy so depend. on how long that takes we could see a. threat to Exxon but still I don't know. if the dependence on fossil fuels is. just going to go away just like that all. right the next stock on our list if you. can already guess based on the. soundtrack that's playing is Home Depot. Home Depot is seriously one of my. favorite stocks it's also a really great. place to visit in case you need some. Home Improvement done and right now. they're paying a 7.60 dividend per share. that you own which equates to about 2.7. percent of a yield Home Depot is one of. those companies that should remain a. beacon of security and stability and. both Home Depot and its competitor. Lowe's have been outperforming the S P. 500 and NASDAQ over the last decade Home. Depot is the largest Home Improvement. retailer in North America with over 2. 300 stores and 150 billion dollars in. revenues in the past 12 months in terms. of the revenue breakdown nearly half of. the revenue comes from professional. contractors and the other half comes. from DIY customers I think that Revenue. breakdown is pretty healthy because. let's say one segment stops buying at. least you have the other segment to kind. of rely on to help make up for that Home. Depot is also wildly profitable they. have 33 gross margins and 17 ebitda. margins which means that their dividend. is not going anywhere anytime soon. another reason I Like Home Depot is that. right now in the United States there. aren't enough homes being built so as we. catch up to that demand of homes wanting. to be built we're going to have to see a. lot more Home Improvement spending go up. so who benefits from that Home Depot. there are really only two retailers in. the space for Home Improvement where. else are you going to go it's either. Home Depot or you go to Lowe's and. because of that I think they have a. monopoly on that Home Improvement sector. which is pretty cool because if you have. a monopoly on the entire sector you're. probably going to be doing just fine as. company it's kind of like owning Google. stock you know how Google stock. basically owns all of the search results. well that creates a really strong. economic moat and the same could be said. for Home Depot all right there is a. bonus stock that I actually want to. throw in this video and that's actually. going to be the ETF voo and vo not many. people think of this but they actually. pay a dividend if you you don't know. what vo is it's an ETF that buys a small. percentage of every company in the S P. 500 so it's known as the S P 500 ETF and. actually pays a dividend yield of 1.57. percent or about 5.65 cents for every. share that you own I mainly want to add. it in here because over the past 10. years I've been investing in vo and in. the beginning the dividends weren't. worth mentioning but these days it's. becoming more significant so I wanted to. call it out this is one of the bonuses. of owning an ETF in your portfolio some. of them actually do pay dividends I. think some people forget that when it. comes to the dividends I always reinvest. it and just try to compound my position. even further okay our last and final. stock for today is Johnson Johnson and. this is a stock that Warren Buffett. still holds today and that's for good. reason they pay a dividend yield of 2.7. percent so in line with JPMorgan Chase. and that comes out to about 4.52 cents. per share annually I think it's another. one of those stable companies that's. going to do well because of what it. offers so if you didn't know Johnson and. Johnson's most popular brands include. Tylenol Listerine Band-Aid pepsid Vino. and Zyrtec the company is pretty much. immune to any economic downturns it's. not like because we're in a depression. or maybe if inflation is high or. interest rates are high doctors are. still going to be prescribing Johnson. Johnson products to their patients the. other thing I like about Johnson Johnson. is that they are a dividend Aristocrat. so that means they've been paying. dividends to their shareholders for the. past 50 or more years and they continue. to increase it as well J J is a value. stock that is going to do well in any. type of environment they're up about one. percent this year so that means they're. outperforming the S P 500 they also have. a bunch of cash on their balance sheet. which I always like seeing and not much. short-term debt which is a good sign. even in the worst of recessions I think. J Will Survive so that's why I really. like them and I think that a large. takeaway from all my Holdings today is. that they're mostly safe and they're. mostly dividends that you can count on. all the time so I hope you enjoyed this. video make sure to grab your toll-free. stocks from Weeble with the link in. description below I don't know how long. that promotion is going to last so get. it while you can if you are interested. in other dividend videos I'll put them. up right here on the screen and I'll see. you guys in the next video which will. hopefully be next week alright peace\n",
      "yo yo yo what's up everybody today I. want to talk to you guys about the five. Golden Rule of real estate investing but. before we do that okay do me a favor if. you guys haven't subscribed to the. channel do me a favor hit that subscribe. button for me okay and also turn on the. notification Bell so you guys can. actually get notified when the next. video we're gonna drop all right with. that all right let's dive in rule number. one on real estate investing right the. golden room one You Gotta Buy right all. the money is made is in the buy not in. the sale people people get all twisted. up they think I'm gonna buy this day I'm. gonna make it up in the back end no you. gotta buy it right at the beginning then. the backed in when you sell it if you. did it right you're gonna make good. money if you don't buy it right and you. praying for the back end to save you. this is where everybody right now is. getting hurt right now in this 2003. market so many investor and Builders I. know that basically have been investing. in this last cycle 20 21 22 they're. losing their ass off right now because. of that reason because they didn't buy. right and then they were helping that. the market going up and the market. didn't turn uh let me give you an. example I bought a property over here in. the north section of Seattle it was a. three lot plat and I had to make sure. that I bought this thing right and the. owner went back and forth and I just had. to basically say look the only way it's. gonna work for me I gotta buy it at this. price for me to buy these three lots. because it's gonna take me two years to. plan a permit and get it built out I. gotta buy this price otherwise I'm. walking finally we came to a party where. I feel good about we bought the property. we built it out and then we had it for. sale here in in the 2022 which is the. worst time because we're in the. recession in 2022 and happened to be. December which is one of the worst month. to sell a home in well we had to lower. the price at the end of the day we end. up selling it we still made good money. because I bought it right if I didn't. buy it right with the 22 recession and. selling in December it would probably. wipe me out on all the profit and I. might even have to come to the table. bringing money to close and this is the. key on buying it right remember all the. money is made in the buy net in the sale. rule number two location location you. probably heard that a thousand times and. I don't think people understand this. there is always location what I call a b. and c a's are a really good area well I. call them good appreciation and good. rent high rent let's call it okay and. then all the way down to like you know. Season D where there's low appreciation. and low rent if you're ever going to. invest in real estate for long term you. want to stay in the area at least A and. B where do you get good appreciation and. good high rent and high cash flow and. when you get good high rent you got to. get cash flow I made the mistake when I. was younger when I went and bought area. in area where it has relatively low. appreciation and you're not going to get. high rent and when will happen is I kept. these property for probably 10 20 years. and by the time I sold these property I. didn't make that much money off the. property after somebody holding it the. rent was decent because the price was. low but the problem was I know I'm. always going to Tamper and upsell my. property one day to get into better area. because when you started you always want. to buy the air that's got cheap price. point and we'll come along cheap price. point is low rent and eventually when. you start having some more money you. want to trade up to get better area I. had too many property I bought in the. what I call the low efficient low rent. and by the time I sold it the. appreciation didn't go much up as high. as I like it to be so I didn't have that. much equity in it as much as I like it. to be but I learned I learned to be. patient I can buy some of that one at. the beginning and then trying to save. money and buy something a little better. otherwise you have too many of them in. those area when you ever want to upgrade. them you're not gonna have that much. Equity to upgrade them into better area. okay this is why you gotta know those. areas low appreciation low rent they're. good for flipping you buy a good deal. you just flip it and be done with it but. if you ever want to buy probably for. rent you want to get everywhere I had. decent appreciation and decent high rent. so you can actually have uh appreciation. and you can have good rent and those. that have property is always going to do. well in the long run get it rule number. three you have to understand your Market. your particular Market I'm a big. Advocate on staying in an area that you. know well I see so many people all. investing all across the United States. and it takes time to understand those. markets all across the United States so. if you're gonna start out trying to. invest in property in your own backyard. okay now if you're fortunate enough you. can find property that's not too cheap. and not too expensive I know some people. who live in a very expensive area but. maybe close to your area maybe you can. find an area that's more you know what I. call a middle class instead of flying. all across the country okay I want to. tell you this when I started real estate. what I used to do I used to go to all. the open houses I want to know what they. sell it for I want to know what they. sell for in this neighborhood with this. neighborhood this neighborhood this. neighborhood or that area this area and. also want know right how much dollar per. square foot they selling for in this. area this area this area in this area I. also want to look at to see you know how. the condition this is a really nice. remodel this is a brand new construction. and I want to know the value of each one. of the remodel in the area and what they. sell for so I get a good idea because if. I ever gonna rehab houses I know in this. area I can't over built in this area I. don't want to underbuild okay so I need. to know that I also wanted to know what. basically what is a typical cost of. rehab or home in this area this area and. this area I I don't wanna in a nice area. I don't want to put the cheap rehab in. those Erica then I'm going to do myself. this Justice I also want to know what. rent I'll see how I'm going for in this. area this air in this area so what I'm. saying is you gotta know everything from. you know purchase price rehab you know. what things are selling for arv in this. area this area in this area the type of. remodels and you gotta know what kind of. rent to go for so you understand the. whole game because before you start. buying because the worst thing I made. when I was younger I didn't study as. well was I should have when I started. investing I was buying property area. that should have been flipped versus I. already I was trying to keep now you. guys I only focus on if this area is for. rent to keep I'm buying this for keep. this area is for flip I only gonna do. for flip and I know my market rule. number four you gotta have a good team I. call it the A Team now if you're a real. estate investor you're gonna need a good. realtor in your site I know about your. market and they know about real estate. investing also okay two you need a good. Banker you need a banker that can do. traditional takeout loan you need a. Harmony lender you need a commercial. lender three you need a good general. contractor a handyman a builder you need. those folks in your pocket you need. architect you need surveys right you. need inspector you need interior. designer you need all these people. people that make up what it takes to. actually buy a house remodel it get it. ready for rent you need a good property. manager okay the better your team is the. less headache you have the worse your. team is the more header you're gonna. have and you might not want to be in. this business the best way to find these. type of people folk is to go network. with other people in your space okay if. you're in your local area go to all the. local meet up in your area find out who. are they using for all their 18 right. and if you go to other areas if you. invest in the other area go find who. they use in those area for bankers and. property manager that way you have an A. team in every area for me I spend most. of my time in Seattle so I got my a team. here in Seattle that way you can. actually scale your business without. actually killing yourself rule number. five which is one of the most important. rule is mindset in anything you do in. life personal Sports Business 80 is. mindset 20 percent is is the action okay. in real estate you gotta have the. mindset you gotta understand folks this. real estate game is a long game you. can't just jump into real estate and. expect to make a gazillion dollar. because you don't know everything about. real estate yet as you the more you. learn the more you earn just remember. that okay there is two type of mindset. you can have in real estate investing. one is I call a short-term mindset the. other one's called a long-term mindset. short-term mindset is basically you. buying property you're fixing them up. and you just flip them and sell them or. you wholesale well that's what I call. the short-term mindset you in and you. out quickly but remember all the wealth. is made in long term flipping business. wholesale business you can be rich. remember being rich is trading your time. for money being wealthy is trading your. money back for time everybody in a. perfect world want to move toward being. wealthy because who want to work for the. rest of their life so sometimes you have. to basically you know trade your time to. make money beginning flipping houses. wholesale because you don't have a lot. of money to actually own real estate the. asset yet to keep my rental so this is. why I said the mindset is when you get. into this business you want to do both. you might at the beginning do a lot more. host selling instead of flipping to make. some money so you can own real estate. because you got to have some down. payments on real estate okay here's the. mindset I see a lot of people are. falling short they say that I flip 50. homes a year I made a lot of money I. asked them well how many of those how. did you actually count and they said. none and I said are you stupid or. something how are you gonna slip all how. not keep any one of them the biggest. regret most investor tell me is they. wish they would have kept more of their. property they flipped look if you're. gonna flip 50 houses at least half of. them you should keep the other half you. should actually flip for cash so you can. actually live have money to get Bank. financing for me you guys I was doing. that I was slipping half and saving half. and I started buying rental uh. eventually today majority of the problem. I do I keep for long term and then some. small amount of them I actually end up. just selling them off so I can get cash. but the name of the game folks is. mindset long term remember when you. invest long term it's a marathon Race. not a Sprint it takes time to own real. estate it takes time to accumulate the. number of property then it take time to. pay them down so you can really see the. massive massive passive income to. understand this early go make a lot of. wholesale go flip and make a lot of. money the sooner you can start owning. real estate the better because you guys. can actually start building your. long-term net worth now you can build in. that cash flow now if you don't start. now by the time you're 56 years old you. don't have enough rental property you're. gonna have to work until you owe and die. alright so that's a wrap I hope you guys. enjoy the five Golden Rule of real. estate investing if you like this please. give me a like comment below what you. gotta think of this if you got questions. thoughts about it please comment below. let me know and and again if you haven't. subscribed hit that subscribe button for. me okay and turn on the notification. Bell for the next video when we drop. other than that have an awesome day. peace\n",
      "why have you advised your wife to invest. in index funds after your death. rather than berkshire hathaway i believe. munger has cancelled his offspring to. quote not be so dumb as to sell. she she won't be she won't be selling. any berkshire. to buy the index funds all all of my. berkshire every single share. will go to philanthropy so that i don't. even regard myself as owning berkshire. you know basically it's it's committed. and. i've i so far about 40 percent has. already been. distributed so the question is somebody. who is not an investment professional. will be i hope reasonably elderly by the. time. that the uh estate gets settled. and what is the. best investment meaning one that. there would be less worry of any kind. connected with. and less people coming around and saying. why don't you sell this and do something. else and all those things. she's going to have more money than she. needs and the big thing then you want is. money not to be a problem. and there will be no way that if she. holds the s. p of virtually no way absent something. happened with weapons of mass. destruction but virtually no way. that she will shall have all the money. that she possibly can use. to have a little liquid money so that if. stocks are down tremendously at some. point. they close the stock exchange for a. while anything like that. she'll still feel that she's got plenty. of money and. the object is not to maximize it doesn't. make any difference. whether the amount she gets doubles or. triples or anything of the sort the. important thing is that she never. worries about money the rest of her life. and i had an aunt katie here in omaha. charlie knew well and worked for her. husband as did i. and she worked very hard all her life. and had. lived in a house she paid i think i. don't know. eight thousand dollars for 45th and. hickory all her life. and uh because she was in berkshire. uh she ended up she lived in 97.. she ended up with you know a few hundred. million. and she would write me a letter. every four or five months and she said. dear warren you know. i hate to bother you but am i going to. run out of money and. and i would i would write her back and. i'd say dear katie. it's a good question because if you live. 986 years you're going to run out of. money. and and then about four or five months. later she'd write me the same winner. again and. i i have seen there's no way in the. world if you've got plenty of money. that it should become a a minus in your. life. and there will be people if you've got a. lot of money. that come around with various. suggestions for you sometimes. well-meaning sometimes not so. well-meaning. so if you've got something that's. certain to deliver you know. it was all in berkshire they'd say well. if warren was alive today you know he. would be telling him to do this i. i just don't want anybody to go through. that and the s p will be a. i think actually what i'm suggesting is. what. but a very high percentage of people. should do something like that. and i don't think they will have us. i think there's a chance they won't have. as much peace of mind. if they own one stock and they've got. neighbors and friends and relatives that. are. trying to do some like i say sometimes. well-intentioned sometimes otherwise. to do something else and so i think it's. a policy that'll get a good result. and it's likely to stick charlie. well as becky said. the wonders are different. i i want them to hold the berkshire well. i want to hold the berkshire too. no i bet i mean i i i don't like them. i recognize the logic of the fact that. that. s p algorithm is very hard to beat. in a diversified portfolio of big. companies. it's all but impossible for most people. but you know it's i'm just more. comfortable with the berkshire well it's. the family business. yeah yeah but but it. uh i've just i've seen too many people. as they get older particularly. being susceptible just having to listen. to the arguments of people. coming well if you're going to protect. your heirs from the stupidity of. others you may have some good system but. i'm not much interested in that subject.
